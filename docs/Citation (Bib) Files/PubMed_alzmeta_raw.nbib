AB  - BACKGROUND: The only conclusive way to diagnose Alzheimer's is to carry out brain 
      autopsy of the patient's brain tissue and ascertain whether the subject had 
      Alzheimer's or any other form of dementia. However, due to the non-feasibility of 
      such methods, to diagnose and conclude the conditions, medical practitioners use 
      tests that examine a patient's mental ability. OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis at 
      an early stage is the need of the hour for initiation of therapy. The cause for 
      most Alzheimer's cases still remains unknown except where genetic distinctions 
      have been observed. Thus, a standard drug regimen ensues in every Alzheimer's 
      patient, irrespective of the cause, which may not always be beneficial in halting 
      or reversing the disease progression. To provide a better life to such patients 
      by suppressing existing symptoms, early diagnosis, curative therapy, 
      site-specific delivery of drugs, and application of hyphenated methods like 
      artificial intelligence need to be brought into the main field of Alzheimer's 
      therapeutics. METHODS: In this review, we have compiled existing hypotheses to 
      explain the cause of the disease, and highlighted gene therapy, immunotherapy, 
      peptidomimetics, metal chelators, probiotics and quantum dots as advancements in 
      the existing strategies to manage Alzheimer's. CONCLUSION: Biomarkers, 
      brain-imaging, and theranostics, along with artificial intelligence, are 
      understood to be the future of the management of Alzheimer's.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex and severe neurodegenerative 
      disease that still lacks effective methods of diagnosis. The current diagnostic 
      methods of AD rely on cognitive tests, imaging techniques and cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) levels of amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42), total tau protein and hyperphosphorylated 
      tau (p-tau). However, the available methods are expensive and relatively 
      invasive. Artificial intelligence techniques like machine learning tools have 
      being increasingly used in precision diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a 
      meta-analysis to investigate the machine learning and novel biomarkers for the 
      diagnosis of AD. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for reviews 
      and trials that investigated the machine learning and novel biomarkers in 
      diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: In additional to Aβ and tau-related biomarkers, 
      biomarkers according to other mechanisms of AD pathology have been investigated. 
      Neuronal injury biomarker includes neurofiliament light (NFL). Biomarkers about 
      synaptic dysfunction and/or loss includes neurogranin, BACE1, synaptotagmin, 
      SNAP-25, GAP-43, synaptophysin. Biomarkers about neuroinflammation includes 
      sTREM2, and YKL-40. Besides, d-glutamate is one of coagonists at the NMDARs. 
      Several machine learning algorithms including support vector machine, logistic 
      regression, random forest, and naïve Bayes) to build an optimal predictive model 
      to distinguish patients with AD from healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      revealed machine learning with novel biomarkers and multiple variables may 
      increase the sensitivity and specificity in diagnosis of AD. Rapid and 
      cost-effective HPLC for biomarkers and machine learning algorithms may assist 
      physicians in diagnosing AD in outpatient clinics.

AB  - Psychiatric disorders are now responsible for the largest proportion of the 
      global burden of disease, and even more challenges have been seen during the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) is commonly used to facilitate 
      the early detection of disease, understand disease progression, and discover new 
      treatments in the fields of both physical and mental health. The present review 
      provides a broad overview of AI methodology and its applications in data 
      acquisition and processing, feature extraction and characterization, psychiatric 
      disorder classification, potential biomarker detection, real-time monitoring, and 
      interventions in psychiatric disorders. We also comprehensively summarize AI 
      applications with regard to the early warning, diagnosis, prognosis, and 
      treatment of specific psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, 
      autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, addiction, 
      sleep disorders, and Alzheimer's disease. The advantages and disadvantages of AI 
      in psychiatry are clarified. We foresee a new wave of research opportunities to 
      facilitate and improve AI technology and its long-term implications in psychiatry 
      during and after the COVID-19 era.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is currently diagnosed using a mixture of psychological 
      tests and clinical observations. However, these diagnoses are not perfect, and 
      additional diagnostic tools (e.g., MRI) can help improve our understanding of AD 
      as well as our ability to detect the disease. Accordingly, a large amount of 
      research has been invested into innovative diagnostic methods for AD. Functional 
      MRI (fMRI) is a form of neuroimaging technology that has been used to diagnose 
      AD; however, fMRI is incredibly noisy, complex, and thus lacks clinical use. 
      Nonetheless, recent innovations in deep learning technology could enable the 
      simplified and streamlined analysis of fMRI. Deep learning is a form of 
      artificial intelligence that uses computer algorithms based on human neural 
      networks to solve complex problems. For example, in fMRI research, deep learning 
      models can automatically denoise images and classify AD by detecting patterns in 
      participants' brain scans. In this systematic review, we investigate how fMRI 
      (specifically resting-state fMRI) and deep learning methods are used to diagnose 
      AD. In turn, we outline the common deep neural network, preprocessing, and 
      classification methods used in the literature. We also discuss the accuracy, 
      strengths, limitations, and future direction of fMRI deep learning methods. In 
      turn, we aim to summarize the current field for new researchers, suggest specific 
      areas for future research, and highlight the potential of fMRI to aid AD 
      diagnoses.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Multiple structural brain changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been revealed on magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI). There is a fast-growing effort in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to 
      analyze these data. Here, we review and evaluate the AI studies in brain MRI 
      analysis with synthesis. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature, spanning 
      the years from 2009 to 2020, was completed using the PubMed database. AI studies 
      using MRI imaging to investigate normal aging, mild cognitive impairment, and 
      AD-dementia were retrieved for review. Bias assessment was completed using the 
      PROBAST criteria. RESULTS: 97 relevant studies were included in the review. The 
      studies were typically focused on the classification of AD, MCI, and normal aging 
      (71% of the reported studies) and the prediction of MCI conversion to AD (25%). 
      The best performance was achieved by using the deep learning-based convolution 
      neural network algorithms (weighted average accuracy 89%), in contrast to 76-86% 
      using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and other AI methods. 
      DISCUSSION: The synthesized evidence is paramount to developing sophisticated AI 
      approaches to reliably capture and quantify multiple subtle MRI changes in the 
      whole brain that exemplify the complexity and heterogeneity of AD and brain 
      aging.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a significant challenge in neurodegenerative 
      research and clinical practice due to its complex etiology and progressive 
      nature. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the diagnosis, 
      treatment, and prognostic modelling of AD holds promising potential to transform 
      the landscape of dementia care. This review explores recent advancements in AI 
      applications across various stages of AD management. In early diagnosis, 
      AI-enhanced neuroimaging techniques, including MRI, PET, and CT scans, enable 
      precise detection of AD biomarkers. Machine learning models analyze these images 
      to identify patterns indicative of early cognitive decline. Additionally, AI 
      algorithms are employed to detect genetic and proteomic biomarkers, facilitating 
      early intervention. Cognitive and behavioral assessments have also benefited from 
      AI, with tools that enhance the accuracy of neuropsychological tests and analyze 
      speech and language patterns for early signs of dementia. Personalized treatment 
      strategies have been revolutionized by AI-driven approaches. In drug discovery, 
      virtual screening and drug repurposing, guided by predictive modelling, 
      accelerate the identification of effective treatments. AI also aids in tailoring 
      therapeutic interventions by predicting individual responses to treatments and 
      monitoring patient progress, allowing for dynamic adjustment of care plans. 
      Prognostic modelling, another critical area, utilizes AI to predict disease 
      progression through longitudinal data analysis and risk prediction models. The 
      integration of multi-modal data, combining clinical, genetic, and imaging 
      information, enhances the accuracy of these predictions. Deep learning techniques 
      are particularly effective in fusing diverse data types to uncover new insights 
      into disease mechanisms and progression. Despite these advancements, challenges 
      remain, including ethical considerations, data privacy, and the need for seamless 
      integration of AI tools into clinical workflows. This review underscores the 
      transformative potential of AI in AD management while highlighting areas for 
      future research and development. By leveraging AI, the healthcare community can 
      improve early diagnosis, personalize treatments, and predict disease outcomes 
      more accurately, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals with 
      AD.

AB  - The complex molecular mechanism and pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      limits the development of effective therapeutics or prevention strategies. 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI)-guided drug discovery combined with 
      genetics/multi-omics (genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
      metabolomics) analysis contributes to the understanding of the pathophysiology 
      and precision medicine of the disease, including AD and AD-related dementia. In 
      this review, we summarize the AI-driven methodologies for AD-agnostic drug 
      discovery and development, including de novo drug design, virtual screening, and 
      prediction of drug-target interactions, all of which have shown potentials. In 
      particular, AI-based drug repurposing emerges as a compelling strategy to 
      identify new indications for existing drugs for AD. We provide several emerging 
      AD targets from human genetics and multi-omics findings and highlight recent 
      AI-based technologies and their applications in drug discovery using AD as a 
      prototypical example. In closing, we discuss future challenges and directions in 
      AI-based drug discovery for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, 
      globally affecting men and women at an exponentially growing rate, with currently 
      no cure. Disease progression starts when dopaminergic neurons begin to die. In 
      PD, the loss of neurotransmitter, dopamine is responsible for the overall 
      communication of neural cells throughout the body. Clinical symptoms of PD are 
      slowness of movement, involuntary muscular contractions, speech & writing 
      changes, lessened automatic movement, and chronic tremors in the body. PD occurs 
      in both familial and sporadic forms and modifiable and non-modifiable risk 
      factors and socioeconomic conditions cause PD. Early detectable diagnostics and 
      treatments have been developed in the last several decades. However, we still do 
      not have precise early detectable biomarkers and therapeutic agents/drugs that 
      prevent and/or delay the disease process. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) 
      science and machine learning tools have been promising in identifying early 
      detectable markers with a greater rate of accuracy compared to past forms of 
      treatment and diagnostic processes. Artificial intelligence refers to the 
      intelligence exhibited by machines or software, distinct from the intelligence 
      observed in humans that is based on neural networks in a form and can be used to 
      diagnose the longevity and disease severity of disease. The term Machine Learning 
      or Neural Networks is a blanket term used to identify an emerging technology that 
      is created to work in the way of a "human brain" using many intertwined neurons 
      to achieve the same level of raw intelligence as that of a brain. These processes 
      have been used for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and 
      Alzheimer's disease, to assess the severity of the patient's condition. In the 
      current article, we discuss the prevalence and incidence of PD, and currently 
      available diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. We also highlighted 
      currently available artificial intelligence science and machine learning tools 
      and their applications to detect disease and develop therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Artificial intelligence for diagnostic and prognostic neuroimaging in dementia: A 
      systematic review.
PG  - 5885-5904
LID - 10.1002/alz.13412 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) and neuroimaging offer new 
      opportunities for diagnosis and prognosis of dementia. METHODS: We systematically 
      reviewed studies reporting AI for neuroimaging in diagnosis and/or prognosis of 
      cognitive neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: A total of 255 studies were 
      identified. Most studies relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative dataset. Algorithmic classifiers were the most commonly used AI method 
      (48%) and discriminative models performed best for differentiating Alzheimer's 
      disease from controls. The accuracy of algorithms varied with the patient cohort, 
      imaging modalities, and stratifiers used. Few studies performed validation in an 
      independent cohort. DISCUSSION: The literature has several methodological 
      limitations including lack of sufficient algorithm development descriptions and 
      standard definitions. We make recommendations to improve model validation 
      including addressing key clinical questions, providing sufficient description of 
      AI methods and validating findings in independent datasets. Collaborative 
      approaches between experts in AI and medicine will help achieve the promising 
      potential of AI tools in practice. HIGHLIGHTS: There has been a rapid expansion 
      in the use of machine learning for diagnosis and prognosis in neurodegenerative 
      disease Most studies (71%) relied on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
      Initiative (ADNI) dataset with no other individual dataset used more than five 
      times There has been a recent rise in the use of more complex discriminative 
      models (e.g., neural networks) that performed better than other classifiers for 
      classification of AD vs healthy controls We make recommendations to address 
      methodological considerations, addressing key clinical questions, and validation 
      We also make recommendations for the field more broadly to standardize outcome 
      measures, address gaps in the literature, and monitor sources of bias.

TI  - Machine learning in mental health: a scoping review of methods and applications.
PG  - 1426-1448
LID - 10.1017/S0033291719000151 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This paper aims to synthesise the literature on machine learning (ML) 
      and big data applications for mental health, highlighting current research and 
      applications in practice. METHODS: We employed a scoping review methodology to 
      rapidly map the field of ML in mental health. Eight health and information 
      technology research databases were searched for papers covering this domain. 
      Articles were assessed by two reviewers, and data were extracted on the article's 
      mental health application, ML technique, data type, and study results. Articles 
      were then synthesised via narrative review. RESULTS: Three hundred papers 
      focusing on the application of ML to mental health were identified. Four main 
      application domains emerged in the literature, including: (i) detection and 
      diagnosis; (ii) prognosis, treatment and support; (iii) public health, and; (iv) 
      research and clinical administration. The most common mental health conditions 
      addressed included depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease. ML 
      techniques used included support vector machines, decision trees, neural 
      networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, and clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the 
      application of ML to mental health has demonstrated a range of benefits across 
      the areas of diagnosis, treatment and support, research, and clinical 
      administration. With the majority of studies identified focusing on the detection 
      and diagnosis of mental health conditions, it is evident that there is 
      significant room for the application of ML to other areas of psychology and 
      mental health. The challenges of using ML techniques are discussed, as well as 
      opportunities to improve and advance the field.

TI  - Amyloid-β PET in Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review and Bayesian 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - e2850
LID - 10.1002/brb3.2850 [doi]
LID - e2850
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      have been successively concluded. Our aim is to determine the efficacy of 
      amyloid-β (Aβ) PET in diagnosing AD and early prediction of mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) converting to AD. By pooling studies from different centers to 
      explore in-depth whether diagnostic performance varies by population type, 
      radiotracer type, and diagnostic approach, thus providing a more comprehensive 
      theoretical basis for the subsequent widespread application of Aβ PET in the 
      clinical setting. METHODS: Relevant studies were searched through PubMed. The 
      pooled sensitivities, specificities, DOR, and the summary ROC curve were obtained 
      based on a Bayesian random-effects model. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies, including 
      5967 patients, were included. Overall, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, DOR, 
      and AUC of Aβ PET for diagnosing AD were 0.90, 0.80, 35.68, and 0.91, 
      respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that Aβ PET had high sensitivity (0.91) 
      and specificity (0.81) for differentiating AD from normal controls but very poor 
      specificity (0.49) for determining AD from MCI. The pooled sensitivity and 
      specificity were 0.84 and 0.62, respectively, for predicting the conversion of 
      MCI to AD. The differences in diagnostic efficacy between visual assessment and 
      quantitative analysis and between (11) C-PIB PET and (18) F-florbetapir PET were 
      insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: The overall performance of Aβ PET in diagnosing AD is 
      favorable, but the differentiation between MCI and AD patients should consider 
      that some MCI may be at risk of conversion to AD and may be misdiagnosed. A 
      multimodal diagnostic approach and machine learning analysis may be effective in 
      improving diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning-aided drug discovery in central 
      nervous system diseases: State-of-the-arts and future directions.
PG  - 1427-1473
LID - 10.1002/med.21764 [doi]
AB  - Neurological disorders significantly outnumber diseases in other therapeutic 
      areas. However, developing drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders 
      remains the most challenging area in drug discovery, accompanied with the long 
      timelines and high attrition rates. With the rapid growth of biomedical data 
      enabled by advanced experimental technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and 
      machine learning (ML) have emerged as an indispensable tool to draw meaningful 
      insights and improve decision making in drug discovery. Thanks to the 
      advancements in AI and ML algorithms, now the AI/ML-driven solutions have an 
      unprecedented potential to accelerate the process of CNS drug discovery with 
      better success rate. In this review, we comprehensively summarize AI/ML-powered 
      pharmaceutical discovery efforts and their implementations in the CNS area. After 
      introducing the AI/ML models as well as the conceptualization and data 
      preparation, we outline the applications of AI/ML technologies to several key 
      procedures in drug discovery, including target identification, compound 
      screening, hit/lead generation and optimization, drug response and synergy 
      prediction, de novo drug design, and drug repurposing. We review the current 
      state-of-the-art of AI/ML-guided CNS drug discovery, focusing on blood-brain 
      barrier permeability prediction and implementation into therapeutic discovery for 
      neurological diseases. Finally, we discuss the major challenges and limitations 
      of current approaches and possible future directions that may provide resolutions 
      to these difficulties.

      challenge, necessitating continuous advancements in diagnostic tools for accurate 
      and early detection. This work explores the recent progress in Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging (MRI) techniques and their application in the realm of neurodegenerative 
      disorders. The introductory section provides a comprehensive overview of the 
      study's background, significance, and objectives. Recognizing the current 
      challenges associated with conventional MRI, the manuscript delves into advanced 
      imaging techniques such as high-resolution structural imaging (HR-MRI), 
      functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission 
      tomography-MRI (PET-MRI) fusion. Each technique is critically examined regarding 
      its potential to address theranostic limitations and contribute to a more nuanced 
      understanding of the underlying pathology. A substantial portion of the work is 
      dedicated to exploring the applications of advanced MRI in specific 
      neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, 
      Huntington's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In addressing the 
      future landscape, the manuscript examines technological advances, including the 
      integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in neuroimaging. The 
      conclusion summarizes key findings, outlines implications for future research, 
      and underscores the importance of these advancements in reshaping our

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cognitive disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, are a global health 
      problem. Digital healthcare technology is an innovative management tool for 
      delaying the progression of dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Thanks to 
      digital technology, the possibility of safe and effective care for patients at 
      home and in the community is increasing, even in situations that threaten the 
      continuity of care, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is difficult to 
      select appropriate technology and alternatives due to the lack of comprehensive 
      reviews on the types and characteristics of digital technology for cognitive 
      impairment, including their effects and limitations. OBJECTIVE: This study aims 
      to identify the types of digital healthcare technology for dementia and mild 
      cognitive impairment and comprehensively examine how its outcome measures were 
      constructed in line with each technology's purpose. METHODS: According to the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for 
      Scoping Reviews guidelines, a literature search was conducted in August 2021 
      using Medline (Ovid), EMBASE, and Cochrane library. The search terms were 
      constructed based on Population-Concept-Context mnemonic: 'dementia', 'cognitive 
      impairment', and 'cognitive decline'; digital healthcare technology, such as big 
      data, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robots, applications, and so on; 
      and the outcomes of digital technology, such as accuracy of diagnosis and 
      physical, mental, and social health. After grasping overall research trends, the 
      literature was classified and analysed in terms of the type of service users and 
      technology. RESULTS: In total, 135 articles were selected. Since 2015, an 
      increase in literature has been observed, and various digital healthcare 
      technologies were identified. For people with mild cognitive impairment, 
      technology for predicting and diagnosing the onset of dementia was studied, and 
      for people with dementia, intervention technology to prevent the deterioration of 
      health and induce significant improvement was considered. Regarding caregivers, 
      many studies were conducted on monitoring and daily living assistive technologies 
      that reduce the burden of care. However, problems such as data collection, 
      storage, safety, and the digital divide persisted at different intensities for 
      each technology type. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed that appropriate 
      technology options and considerations may differ depending on the characteristics 
      of users. It also emphasises the role of humans in designing and managing 
      technology to apply digital healthcare technology more effectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), as a significant part of the 
      global pharmaceutical science, the abundant molecular compounds it contains is a 
      valuable potential source of designing and screening new drugs. However, due to 
      the un-estimated quantity of the natural molecular compounds and diversity of the 
      related problems drug discovery such as precise screening of molecular compounds 
      or the evaluation of efficacy, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetics, 
      it is arduous for researchers to design or screen applicable compounds through 
      old methods. With the rapid development of computer technology recently, 
      especially artificial intelligence (AI), its innovation in the field of virtual 
      screening contributes to an increasing efficiency and accuracy in the process of 
      discovering new drugs. PURPOSE: This study systematically reviewed the 
      application of computational approaches and artificial intelligence in drug 
      virtual filtering and devising of TCM and presented the potential perspective of 
      computer-aided TCM development. STUDY DESIGN: We made a systematic review 
      following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA) guidelines. Then screening the most typical articles for our research. 
      METHODS: The systematic review was performed by following the PRISMA guidelines. 
      The databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI were used to search for 
      publications that focused on computer-aided drug virtual screening and design in 
      TCM. RESULT: Totally, 42 corresponding articles were included in literature 
      reviewing. Aforementioned studies were of great significance to the treatment and 
      cost control of many challenging diseases such as COVID-19, diabetes, Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD), etc. Computational approaches and AI were widely used in virtual 
      screening in the process of TCM advancing, which include structure-based virtual 
      screening (SBVS) and ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS). Besides, 
      computational technologies were also extensively applied in absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) prediction of candidate 
      drugs and new drug design in crucial course of drug discovery. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      applications of computer and AI play an important role in the drug virtual 
      screening and design in the field of TCM, with huge application prospects.

AB  - Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is regarded as the first clinical 
      manifestation in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. Investigating 
      populations with SCD is important for understanding the early pathological 
      mechanisms of AD and identifying SCD-related biomarkers, which are critical for 
      the early detection of AD. With the advent of advanced neuroimaging techniques, 
      such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
      accumulating evidence has revealed structural and functional brain alterations 
      related to the symptoms of SCD. In this review, we summarize the main imaging 
      features and key findings regarding SCD related to AD, from local and regional 
      data to connectivity-based imaging measures, with the aim of delineating a 
      multimodal imaging signature of SCD due to AD. Additionally, the interaction of 
      SCD with other risk factors for dementia due to AD, such as age and the 
      Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ɛ4 status, has also been described. Finally, the possible 
      explanations for the inconsistent and heterogeneous neuroimaging findings 
      observed in individuals with SCD are discussed, along with future directions. 
      Overall, the literature reveals a preferential vulnerability of AD signature 
      regions in SCD in the context of AD, supporting the notion that individuals with 
      SCD share a similar pattern of brain alterations with patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia due to AD. We conclude that these 
      neuroimaging techniques, particularly multimodal neuroimaging techniques, have 
      great potential for identifying the underlying pathological alterations 
      associated with SCD. More longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes combined 
      with more advanced imaging modeling approaches such as artificial intelligence 
      are still warranted to establish their clinical utility.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis 
      (MS), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are 
      increasingly prevalent as global populations age. Fluid biomarkers, derived from 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, saliva, urine, and exosomes, offer a promising 
      solution for early diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. These biomarkers 
      can reflect critical pathological processes like amyloid-beta (Aβ) deposition, 
      tau protein hyperphosphorylation, α-syn misfolding, TDP-43 mislocalization and 
      aggregation, and neuronal damage, enabling detection long before clinical 
      symptoms emerge. Recent advances in blood-based biomarkers, particularly plasma 
      Aβ, phosphorylated tau, and TDP-43, have shown diagnostic accuracy equivalent to 
      CSF biomarkers, offering more accessible testing options. This review discusses 
      the current challenges in fluid biomarker research, including variability, 
      standardization, and sensitivity issues, and explores how combining multiple 
      biomarkers with clinical symptoms improves diagnostic reliability. Ethical 
      considerations, future directions involving extracellular vehicles (EVs), and the 
      integration of artificial intelligence (AI) are also highlighted. Continued 
      research efforts will be key to overcoming these obstacles, enabling fluid 
      biomarkers to become crucial tools in personalized medicine for neurodegenerative 
      diseases.

TI  - Diagnostic power of resting-state fMRI for detection of network connectivity in 
      Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review.
PG  - 2941-2968
LID - 10.1002/hbm.25369 [doi]
AB  - Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) detects functional connectivity (FC) abnormalities 
      that occur in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). FC of the default mode network (DMN) is commonly 
      impaired in AD and MCI. We conducted a systematic review aimed at determining the 
      diagnostic power of rs-fMRI to identify FC abnormalities in the DMN of patients 
      with AD or MCI compared with healthy controls (HCs) using machine learning (ML) 
      methods. Multimodal support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was the commonest form 
      of ML method utilized. Multiple kernel approach can be utilized to aid in the 
      classification by incorporating various discriminating features, such as FC 
      graphs based on "nodes" and "edges" together with structural MRI-based regional 
      cortical thickness and gray matter volume. Other multimodal features include 
      neuropsychiatric testing scores, DTI features, and regional cerebral blood flow. 
      Among AD patients, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/Precuneus was noted to be 
      a highly affected hub of the DMN that demonstrated overall reduced FC. Whereas 
      reduced DMN FC between the PCC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was observed 
      in MCI patients. Evidence indicates that the nodes of the DMN can offer moderate 
      to high diagnostic power to distinguish AD and MCI patients. Nevertheless, 
      various concerns over the homogeneity of data based on patient selection, scanner 
      effects, and the variable usage of classifiers and algorithms pose a challenge 
      for ML-based image interpretation of rs-fMRI datasets to become a mainstream 
      option for diagnosing AD and predicting the conversion of HC/MCI to AD.

AB  - Ophthalmic biomarkers have long played a critical role in diagnosing and managing 
      ocular diseases. Oculomics has emerged as a field that utilizes ocular imaging 
      biomarkers to provide insights into systemic diseases. Advances in diagnostic and 
      imaging technologies including electroretinography, optical coherence tomography 
      (OCT), confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging 
      ophthalmoscopy, and OCT angiography have revolutionized the ability to understand 
      systemic diseases and even detect them earlier than clinical manifestations for 
      earlier intervention. With the advent of increasingly large ophthalmic imaging 
      datasets, machine learning models can be integrated into these ocular imaging 
      biomarkers to provide further insights and prognostic predictions of 
      neurodegenerative disease. In this manuscript, we review the use of ophthalmic 
      imaging to provide insights into neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer 
      Disease, Parkinson Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington 
      Disease. We discuss recent advances in ophthalmic technology including 
      eye-tracking technology and integration of artificial intelligence techniques to 
      further provide insights into these neurodegenerative diseases. Ultimately, 
      oculomics opens the opportunity to detect and monitor systemic diseases at a 
      higher acuity. Thus, earlier detection of systemic diseases may allow for timely 
      intervention for improving the quality of life in patients with neurodegenerative 
      disease.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Artificial intelligence tools are being rapidly integrated 
      into clinical environments and may soon be incorporated into dementia diagnostic 
      paradigms. A comprehensive review of emerging trends will allow physicians and 
      other healthcare providers to better anticipate and understand these powerful 
      tools. RECENT FINDINGS: Machine learning models that utilize cerebral biomarkers 
      are demonstrably effective for dementia identification and prediction; however, 
      cerebral biomarkers are relatively expensive and not widely available. As eye 
      images harbor several ophthalmic biomarkers that mirror the state of the brain 
      and can be clinically observed with routine imaging, eye-based machine learning 
      models are an emerging area, with efficacy comparable with cerebral-based machine 
      learning models. Emerging machine learning architectures like recurrent, 
      convolutional, and partially pretrained neural networks have proven to be 
      promising frontiers for feature extraction and classification with ocular 
      biomarkers. SUMMARY: Machine learning models that can accurately distinguish 
      those with symptomatic Alzheimer's dementia from those with mild cognitive 
      impairment and normal cognition as well as predict progressive disease using 
      relatively inexpensive and accessible ocular imaging inputs are impactful tools 
      for the diagnosis and risk stratification of Alzheimer's dementia continuum. If 
      these machine learning models can be incorporated into clinical care, they may 
      simplify diagnostic efforts. Recent advancements in ocular-based machine learning 
      efforts are promising steps forward.

      the elderly and pre-elderly population. This progressive neurological disorder is 
      characterized by an array of symptoms including memory loss, cognitive decline, 
      and various physiological and psychological disturbances, significantly 
      compromising the quality of life of patients and their caregivers. Recent 
      advancements in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) technology have catalyzed 
      research in AI-enhanced diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease, fostering optimism 
      for early detection and timely interventions. This progress has paved the way for 
      the development of sophisticated algorithms and models adept at analyzing complex 
      brain imaging data, thereby augmenting diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This 
      advancement fuels optimism regarding the transformative potential of AI-driven 
      diagnostics in revolutionizing Alzheimer's disease management, with the prospect 
      of facilitating more effective treatment strategies and improved patient 
      outcomes. The objective of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of 
      recent developments in deep learning methodologies applied to brain MRI images 
      for the classification of various stages of Alzheimer's disease, with a 
      particular emphasis on early diagnosis. Furthermore, this review underscores the 
      limitations of current research, discussing potential challenges and future 
      research directions in this dynamic field.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disease that 
      results in a progressive decline in cognitive abilities. Since AD starts several 
      years before the onset of the symptoms, its early detection is challenging due to 
      subtle changes in biomarkers mainly detectable in different neuroimaging 
      modalities. Developing computer-aided diagnostic models based on deep learning 
      can provide excellent opportunities for the analysis of different neuroimage 
      modalities along with other non-image biomarkers. In this survey, we perform a 
      comparative analysis of about 100 published papers since 2019 that employ basic 
      deep architectures such as CNN, RNN, and generative models for AD diagnosis. 
      Moreover, about 60 papers that have applied a trending topic or architecture for 
      AD are investigated. Explainable models, normalizing flows, graph-based deep 
      architectures, self-supervised learning, and attention mechanisms are considered. 
      The main challenges in this body of literature have been categorized and 
      explained from data-related, methodology-related, and clinical adoption aspects. 
      We conclude our paper by addressing some future perspectives and providing 
      recommendations to conduct further studies for AD diagnosis.

AB  - Applications of machine learning (ML) in translational medicine include 
      therapeutic drug creation, diagnostic development, surgical planning, outcome 
      prediction, and intraoperative assistance. Opportunities in the neurosciences are 
      rich given advancement in our understanding of the brain, expanding indications 
      for intervention, and diagnostic challenges often characterized by multiple 
      clinical and environmental factors. We present a review of ML in neuro-oncology, 
      epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia to highlight recent progression 
      in these field, optimizing machine learning capabilities in their current forms. 
      Supervised learning models appear to be the most commonly incorporated algorithm 
      models for machine learning across the reviewed neuroscience disciplines with 
      primary aim of diagnosis. Accuracy ranges are high from 63% to 99% across all 
      algorithms investigated. Machine learning contributions to neurosurgery, 
      neurology, psychiatry, and the clinical and basic science neurosciences may 
      enhance current medical best practices while also broadening our understanding of 
      dynamic neural networks and the brain.

AB  - Recent revisions to the diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      incorporated conceptual advances in the field. Specifically, AD is now recognized 
      to encompass a continuum, spanning from preclinical (accruing brain pathology in 
      the absence of symptoms) through symptomatic predementia (prodromal AD, mild 
      cognitive impairment) and dementia phases. The role of biological markers 
      (biomarkers) of both the underlying molecular pathologies and related 
      neurodegenerative changes has also been acknowledged. In this abridged review, we 
      provide an overview of fluid (cerebrospinal fluid and blood) and molecular 
      imaging-based biomarkers used within the field and discuss the potential role of 
      computer driven artificial intelligence approaches for both the early and 
      accurate identification of AD and as a tool for population enrichment in clinical 
      trials testing candidate disease modifying therapies.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning based approaches are increasingly 
      finding their way into various areas of nuclear medicine imaging. With the 
      technical development of new methods and the expansion to new fields of 
      application, this trend is likely to become even more pronounced in future. 
      Possible means of application range from automated image reading and 
      classification to correlation with clinical outcomes and to technological 
      applications in image processing and reconstruction. In the context of tumor 
      imaging, that is, predominantly FDG or PSMA PET imaging but also bone 
      scintigraphy, artificial intelligence approaches can be used to quantify the 
      whole-body tumor volume, for the segmentation and classification of pathological 
      foci or to facilitate the diagnosis of micro-metastases. More advanced 
      applications aim at the correlation of image features that are derived by 
      artificial intelligence with clinical endpoints, for example, whole-body tumor 
      volume with overall survival. In nuclear medicine imaging of benign diseases, 
      artificial intelligence methods are predominantly used for automated and/or 
      facilitated image classification and clinical decision making. Automated feature 
      selection, segmentation and classification of myocardial perfusion scintigraphy 
      can help in identifying patients that would benefit from intervention and to 
      forecast clinical prognosis. Automated reporting of neurodegenerative diseases 
      such as Alzheimer's disease might be extended to early diagnosis-being of special 
      interest, if targeted treatment options might become available. Technological 
      approaches include artificial intelligence-based attenuation correction of PET 
      images, image reconstruction or anatomical landmarking. Attenuation correction is 
      of special interest for avoiding the need of a coregistered CT scan, in the 
      process of image reconstruction artefacts might be reduced, or ultra low-dose PET 
      images might be denoised. The development of accurate ultra low-dose PET imaging 
      might broaden the method's applicability, for example, toward oncologic PET 
      screening. Most artificial intelligence approaches in nuclear medicine imaging 
      are still in early stages of development, further improvements are necessary for 
      broad clinical applications. In this review, we describe the current trends in 
      the context fields of body oncology, cardiac imaging, and neuroimaging while an 
      additional section puts emphasis on technological trends. Our aim is not only to 
      describe currently available methods, but also to place a special focus on the 
      description of possible future developments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease has become one of the most common 
      neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, which seriously affects the health of the 
      elderly. Early detection and intervention are the most effective prevention 
      methods currently. Compared with traditional detection methods such as 
      traditional scale tests, electroencephalograms, and magnetic resonance imaging, 
      speech analysis is more convenient for automatic large-scale Alzheimer's disease 
      detection and has attracted extensive attention from researchers. In particular, 
      deep learning-based speech analysis and language processing techniques for 
      Alzheimer's disease detection have been studied and achieved impressive results. 
      METHODS: To integrate the latest research progresses, hundreds of relevant papers 
      from ACM, DBLP, IEEE, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science electronic databases, and 
      other sources were retrieved. We used these keywords for paper search: (Alzheimer 
      OR dementia OR cognitive impairment) AND (speech OR voice OR audio) AND (deep 
      learning OR neural network). CONCLUSIONS: Fifty-two papers were finally retained 
      after screening. We reviewed and presented the speech databases, deep learning 
      methods, and model performances of these studies. In the end, we pointed out the 
      mainstreams and limitations in the current studies and provided a direction for 
      future research.

AB  - A growing body of evidence currently proposes that deep learning approaches can 
      serve as an essential cornerstone for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). In light of the latest advancements in neuroimaging and genomics, 
      numerous deep learning models are being exploited to distinguish AD from normal 
      controls and/or to distinguish AD from mild cognitive impairment in recent 
      research studies. In this review, we focus on the latest developments for AD 
      prediction using deep learning techniques in cooperation with the principles of 
      neuroimaging and genomics. First, we narrate various investigations that make use 
      of deep learning algorithms to establish AD prediction using genomics or 
      neuroimaging data. Particularly, we delineate relevant integrative neuroimaging 
      genomics investigations that leverage deep learning methods to forecast AD on the 
      basis of incorporating both neuroimaging and genomics data. Moreover, we outline 
      the limitations as regards to the recent AD investigations of deep learning with 
      neuroimaging and genomics. Finally, we depict a discussion of challenges and 
      directions for future research. The main novelty of this work is that we 
      summarize the major points of these investigations and scrutinize the 
      similarities and differences among these investigations.

TI  - Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Retinal Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease: 
      Potential and Perspectives.
PG  - 39-50
LID - 10.3233/JAD-230055 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a global health challenge in the 21st century 
      due to its increasing prevalence as the major cause of dementia. State-of-the-art 
      artificial intelligence (AI)-based tests could potentially improve 
      population-based strategies to detect and manage AD. Current retinal imaging 
      demonstrates immense potential as a non-invasive screening measure for AD, by 
      studying qualitative and quantitative changes in the neuronal and vascular 
      structures of the retina that are often associated with degenerative changes in 
      the brain. On the other hand, the tremendous success of AI, especially deep 
      learning, in recent years has encouraged its incorporation with retinal imaging 
      for predicting systemic diseases. Further development in deep reinforcement 
      learning (DRL), defined as a subfield of machine learning that combines deep 
      learning and reinforcement learning, also prompts the question of how it can work 
      hand in hand with retinal imaging as a viable tool for automated prediction of 
      AD. This review aims to discuss potential applications of DRL in using retinal 
      imaging to study AD, and their synergistic application to unlock other 
      possibilities, such as AD detection and prediction of AD progression. Challenges 
      and future directions, such as the use of inverse DRL in defining reward 
      function, lack of standardization in retinal imaging, and data availability, will 
      also be addressed to bridge gaps for its transition into clinical use.

TI  - Revolutionizing early Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment 
      diagnosis: a deep learning MRI meta-analysis.
PG  - 1-10

AB  - BACKGROUND:  The early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) remains a significant challenge in neurology, with conventional 
      methods often limited by subjectivity and variability in interpretation. 
      Integrating deep learning with artificial intelligence (AI) in magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) analysis emerges as a transformative approach, offering the 
      potential for unbiased, highly accurate diagnostic insights. OBJECTIVE:  A 
      meta-analysis was designed to analyze the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning of 
      MRI images on AD and MCI models. METHODS:  A meta-analysis was performed across 
      PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases following the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, focusing on 
      the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning. Subsequently, methodological quality 
      was assessed using the QUADAS-2 checklist. Diagnostic measures, including 
      sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, and area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were analyzed, 
      alongside subgroup analyses for T1-weighted and non-T1-weighted MRI. RESULTS:  A 
      total of 18 eligible studies were identified. The Spearman correlation 
      coefficient was -0.6506. Meta-analysis showed that the combined sensitivity and 
      specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic 
      odds ratio were 0.84, 0.86, 6.0, 0.19, and 32, respectively. The AUROC was 0.92. 
      The quiescent point of hierarchical summary of receiver operating characteristic 
      (HSROC) was 3.463. Notably, the images of 12 studies were acquired by T1-weighted 
      MRI alone, and those of the other 6 were gathered by non-T1-weighted MRI alone. 
      CONCLUSION:  Overall, deep learning of MRI for the diagnosis of AD and MCI showed 
      good sensitivity and specificity and contributed to improving diagnostic 
      accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The improvement of health indicators and life expectancy, especially 
      in developed countries, has led to population growth and increased age-related 
      diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, the early detection of AD is 
      valuable to stop its progress at an early stage. METHOD: This study 
      systematically reviewed the current state of using deep learning methods on 
      neuroimaging data for timely diagnose of AD. We reviewed different deep models, 
      modalities, feature extraction strategies, and parameter initialization methods 
      to find out which model or strategy could offer better performance. RESULTS: Our 
      search in eight different databases resulted in 736 studies, from which 74 
      studies were included to be reviewed for data analysis. Most studies have 
      reported the normal control (NC)/AD classification and have shown desirable 
      results. Although recent studies showed promising results of utilizing deep 
      models on the NC/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and NC/early MCI (eMCI), other 
      classification groups should be taken into consideration and improved. 
      DISCUSSION: The results of our review indicate that the comparative analysis is 
      challenging in this area due to the lack of a benchmark platform; however, 
      convolutional neural network (CNN)-based models, especially in an ensemble way, 
      seem to perform better than other deep models. The transfer learning approach 
      also could efficiently improve the performance and time complexity. Further 
      research on designing a benchmark platform to facilitate the comparative analysis 
      is recommended.

AB  - Genetics and omics studies of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia subtypes 
      enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms and pathways that can be 
      targeted. We identified key remaining challenges: First, can we enhance genetic 
      studies to address missing heritability? Can we identify reproducible omics 
      signatures that differentiate between dementia subtypes? Can high-dimensional 
      omics data identify improved biomarkers? How can genetics inform our 
      understanding of causal status of dementia risk factors? And which biological 
      processes are altered by dementia-related genetic variation? Artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning approaches give us powerful new tools in 
      helping us to tackle these challenges, and we review possible solutions and 
      examples of best practice. However, their limitations also need to be considered, 
      as well as the need for coordinated multidisciplinary research and diverse deeply 
      phenotyped cohorts. Ultimately AI approaches improve our ability to interrogate 
      genetics and omics data for precision dementia medicine. HIGHLIGHTS: We have 
      identified five key challenges in dementia genetics and omics studies. AI can 
      enable detection of undiscovered patterns in dementia genetics and omics data. 
      Enhanced and more diverse genetics and omics datasets are still needed. 
      Multidisciplinary collaborative efforts using AI can boost dementia research.

AB  - One of the current challenges in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to 
      identify patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that will convert to AD. 
      Artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning (ML), has established as 
      one of more powerful approach to extract reliable predictors and to automatically 
      classify different AD phenotypes. It is time to accelerate the translation of 
      this knowledge in clinical practice, mainly by using low-cost features 
      originating from the neuropsychological assessment. We performed a meta-analysis 
      to assess the contribution of ML and neuropsychological measures for the 
      automated classification of MCI patients and the prediction of their conversion 
      to AD. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of patients' classifications was 
      obtained by means of a quantitative bivariate random-effect meta-analytic 
      approach. Although a high heterogeneity was observed, the results of 
      meta-analysis show that ML applied to neuropsychological measures can lead to a 
      successful automatic classification, being more specific as screening rather than 
      prognosis tool. Relevant categories of neuropsychological tests can be extracted 
      by ML that maximize the classification accuracy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An increase in lifespan in our society is a double-edged sword that 
      entails a growing number of patients with neurocognitive disorders, Alzheimer's 
      disease being the most prevalent. Advances in medical imaging and computational 
      power enable new methods for the early detection of neurocognitive disorders with 
      the goal of preventing or reducing cognitive decline. Computer-aided image 
      analysis and early detection of changes in cognition is a promising approach for 
      patients with mild cognitive impairment, sometimes a prodromal stage of 
      Alzheimer's disease dementia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following 
      PRISMA guidelines of studies where machine learning was applied to neuroimaging 
      data in order to predict whether patients with mild cognitive impairment might 
      develop Alzheimer's disease dementia or remain stable. After removing duplicates, 
      we screened 452 studies and selected 116 for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: Most 
      studies used magnetic resonance image (MRI) and positron emission tomography 
      (PET) data but also magnetoencephalography. The datasets were mainly extracted 
      from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database with some 
      exceptions. Regarding the algorithms used, the most common was support vector 
      machine with a mean accuracy of 75.4%, but convolutional neural networks achieved 
      a higher mean accuracy of 78.5%. Studies combining MRI and PET achieved overall 
      better classification accuracy than studies that only used one neuroimaging 
      technique. In general, the more complex models such as those based on deep 
      learning, combined with multimodal and multidimensional data (neuroimaging, 
      clinical, cognitive, genetic, and behavioral) achieved the best performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although the performance of the different methods still has room for 
      improvement, the results are promising and this methodology has a great potential 
      as a support tool for clinicians and healthcare professionals.

      Biomarkers: The Role of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning.
LID - 10.3390/s23094184 [doi]
LID - 4184
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is now classified as a silent pandemic due to concerning 
      current statistics and future predictions. Despite this, no effective treatment 
      or accurate diagnosis currently exists. The negative impacts of invasive 
      techniques and the failure of clinical trials have prompted a shift in research 
      towards non-invasive treatments. In light of this, there is a growing need for 
      early detection of AD through non-invasive approaches. The abundance of data 
      generated by non-invasive techniques such as blood component monitoring, imaging, 
      wearable sensors, and bio-sensors not only offers a platform for more accurate 
      and reliable bio-marker developments but also significantly reduces patient pain, 
      psychological impact, risk of complications, and cost. Nevertheless, there are 
      challenges concerning the computational analysis of the large quantities of data 
      generated, which can provide crucial information for the early diagnosis of AD. 
      Hence, the integration of artificial intelligence and deep learning is critical 
      to addressing these challenges. This work attempts to examine some of the facts 
      and the current situation of these approaches to AD diagnosis by leveraging the 
      potential of these tools and utilizing the vast amount of non-invasive data in 
      order to revolutionize the early detection of AD according to the principles of a 
      new non-invasive medicine era.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a devastating neurodegenerative disease with few 
      preventive or curative treatments available. Modern technology developments of 
      high-throughput omics platforms and imaging equipment provide unprecedented 
      opportunities to study the etiology and progression of this disease. Meanwhile, 
      the vast amount of data from various modalities, such as genetics, proteomics, 
      transcriptomics, and imaging, as well as clinical features impose great 
      challenges in data integration and analysis. Machine learning (ML) methods offer 
      novel techniques to address high dimensional data, integrate data from different 
      sources, model the etiological and clinical heterogeneity, and discover new 
      biomarkers. These directions have the potential to help us better manage the 
      disease progression and develop novel treatment strategies. This mini-review 
      paper summarizes different ML methods that have been applied to study AD using 
      single-platform or multi-modal data. We review the current state of ML 
      applications for five key directions of AD research: disease classification, drug 
      repurposing, subtyping, progression prediction, and biomarker discovery. This 
      summary provides insights about the current research status of ML-based AD 
      research and highlights potential directions for future research.

AB  - Several major challenges, including an ageing population and declining workforce 
      and the implementation of recent breakthrough therapies for Alzheimer disease, 
      are prompting a necessary rethink of how people with neurodegenerative dementias 
      are diagnosed and medically managed. Digital health technologies could play a 
      pivotal part in this transformation, with new advances enabling the collection of 
      millions of data points from a single individual. Possible applications include 
      unobtrusive monitoring that aids early detection of disease and artificial 
      intelligence-based health advice. To translate these advances to meaningful 
      benefits for people living with a disease, technologies must be implemented 
      within a system that retains the physician expert as a central figure in 
      decision-making. This Perspective presents a new framework, termed the Digitized 
      Memory Clinic, for the diagnostic pathway of neurodegenerative dementias that 
      incorporates digital health technologies with currently available assessment 
      tools, such as fluid and imaging biomarkers, in an interplay with the physician. 
      The Digitized Memory Clinic will manage people across the entire disease 
      spectrum, from the detection of risk factors for cognitive decline and the 
      earliest symptoms to dementia, and will replace the present paradigm of a pure 
      'brick-and-mortar' memory clinic. Important ethical, legal and societal barriers 
      associated with the implementation of digital health technologies in memory 
      clinics need to be addressed. The envisioned Digitized Memory Clinic aims to 
      improve diagnostics and enable precise disease-tracking prognostication for 
      individuals with memory disorders and to open new possibilities, such as 
      precision medicine for prevention and treatment.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an umbrella term that represents a new technology 
      for simulating and expanding human intelligence by using machines and computer 
      systems. It consists of methods such as machine learning (ML), deep learning 
      (DL), and natural language processing (NLP). In the era of big data, AI has 
      emerged as an essential tool for improving the detection of neurodegenerative 
      diseases, such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD), Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis, etc. AI with its ability to extract critical information from 
      the mass of data has enabled scientists to deal with various types of 
      large-volume data, including genetic data, imaging data, and clinical data, 
      rapidly generated in the course of neurodegenerative disease research. This 
      review provides a comprehensive overview of the literature on current AI 
      applications in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. Firstly, 
      bioinformatics and AI approaches to identify potential biomarkers for 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as AD are reviewed. Secondly, the use of ML and 
      DL methods to analyze Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data for a better 
      understanding of disease progression and predicting patient outcomes is 
      discussed. Finally, the use of AI methods including NLP for Electronic Health 
      Record (EHR) data analysis to extract meaningful information and identify 
      patterns that may contribute to early diagnosis and treatment planning are 
      reviewed. The potential benefits of AI-based approaches in improving patient 
      outcomes and the challenges associated with their implementations are also 
      discussed. Overall, this paper highlights the promise of AI in transforming the 
      diagnosis and management of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - We still do not have an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD) despite 
      it being the most common cause of dementia and impaired cognitive function. Thus, 
      research endeavors are directed toward identifying AD biomarkers and targets. In 
      this regard, we designed a computational method that exploits multiple hub gene 
      ranking methods and feature selection methods with machine learning and deep 
      learning to identify biomarkers and targets. First, we used three AD gene 
      expression datasets to identify 1/ hub genes based on six ranking algorithms 
      (Degree, Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC), Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC), 
      Betweenness Centrality (BC), Closeness Centrality, and Stress Centrality), 2/ 
      gene subsets based on two feature selection methods (LASSO and Ridge). Then, we 
      developed machine learning and deep learning models to determine the gene subset 
      that best distinguishes AD samples from the healthy controls. This work shows 
      that feature selection methods achieve better prediction performances than the 
      hub gene sets. Beyond this, the five genes identified by both feature selection 
      methods (LASSO and Ridge algorithms) achieved an AUC = 0.979. We further show 
      that 70% of the upregulated hub genes (among the 28 overlapping hub genes) are AD 
      targets based on a literature review and six miRNA (hsa-mir-16-5p, 
      hsa-mir-34a-5p, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-26a-5p, hsa-mir-93-5p, hsa-mir-155-5p) and 
      one transcription factor, JUN, are associated with the upregulated hub genes. 
      Furthermore, since 2020, four of the six microRNA were also shown to be potential 
      AD targets. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing that such a small 
      number of genes can distinguish AD samples from healthy controls with high 
      accuracy and that overlapping upregulated hub genes can narrow the search space 
      for potential novel targets.

TI  - The Role of Blood-Based Biomarkers in Transforming Alzheimer's Disease Research 
      and Clinical Management: A Review.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition 
      representing the most common cause of dementia and currently affects millions of 
      people worldwide. The clinical presentation includes memory impairment, cognitive 
      decline, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, reflecting pathological hallmarks such as 
      β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, synaptic dysfunction, and 
      neuroinflammation. Despite being the gold standard for detecting amyloid and tau 
      pathologies in vivo, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and positron emission 
      tomography (PET) imaging are not widely used in the clinical setting because of 
      invasiveness, high costs, and restricted accessibility. Recent advances in 
      blood-based biomarkers offer a promising and minimally invasive tool for early 
      detection, diagnosis, and monitoring of AD. Ultra-sensitive analytical platforms, 
      including single-molecule arrays (Simoa) and immunoprecipitation-mass 
      spectrometry, now enable reliable quantification of plasma Aβ isoforms, 
      phosphorylated tau variants (p-Tau181, p-Tau217, p-Tau231), neurofilament light 
      chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In addition, blood 
      biomarkers reflecting oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, synaptic disruption 
      and metabolic dysfunction are under active investigation. This narrative review 
      synthesizes current evidence on blood-based biomarkers in AD, emphasizing their 
      biological relevance, diagnostic accuracy, and clinical applications. Finally, we 
      highlight forthcoming challenges, such as standardization, and future directions, 
      including the use of artificial intelligence in precision medicine.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incredibly complex and presently incurable 
      age-related brain disorder. To better understand this debilitating disease, we 
      collated and performed a meta-analysis on publicly available RNA-Seq, microarray, 
      proteomics, and microRNA samples derived from AD patients and non-AD controls. 
      4089 samples originating from brain tissues and blood remained after applying 
      quality filters. Since disease progression in AD correlates with age, we 
      stratified this large dataset into three different age groups: < 75 years, 75-84 
      years, and ≥ 85 years. The RNA-Seq, microarray, and proteomics datasets were then 
      combined into different integrated datasets. Ensemble machine learning was 
      employed to identify genes and proteins that can accurately classify samples as 
      either AD or control. These predictive inputs were then subjected to 
      network-based enrichment analyses. The ability of genes/proteins associated with 
      different pathways in the Molecular Signatures Database to diagnose AD was also 
      tested. We separately identified microRNAs that can be used to make an AD 
      diagnosis and subjected the predicted gene targets of the most predictive 
      microRNAs to an enrichment analysis. The following key themes emerged from our 
      machine learning and bioinformatics analyses: cell death, cellular senescence, 
      energy metabolism, genomic integrity, glia, immune system, metal ion homeostasis, 
      oxidative stress, proteostasis, and synaptic function. Many of the results 
      demonstrated unique age-specificity. For example, terms highlighting cellular 
      senescence only emerged in the earliest and intermediate age ranges while the 
      majority of results relevant to cell death appeared in the youngest patients. 
      Existing literature corroborates the importance of these hallmarks in AD.

AB  - Dementia is a chronic syndrome which is common among the elderly and is 
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality for patients and their 
      caregivers. Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of clinical dementia, 
      is biologically characterized by the deposition of amyloid-β plaques and 
      neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. The onset of AD begins decades before 
      manifestation of symptoms and clinical diagnosis, underlining the need to shift 
      from clinical diagnosis of AD to a more objective diagnosis using biomarkers. 
      Having performed a literature search of original articles and reviews on PubMed 
      and Google Scholar, we present this review detailing the existing biomarkers and 
      risk assessment tools for AD. The prevalence of dementia in low- and 
      middle-income countries (LMICs) is predicted to increase over the next couple of 
      years. Thus, we aimed to identify potential biomarkers that may be appropriate 
      for use in LMICs, considering the following factors: sensitivity, specificity, 
      invasiveness, and affordability of the biomarkers. We also explored risk 
      assessment tools and the potential use of artificial intelligence/machine 
      learning solutions for diagnosing, assessing risks, and monitoring the 
      progression of AD in low-resource settings. Routine use of AD biomarkers has yet 
      to gain sufficient ground in clinical settings. Therefore, clinical diagnosis of 
      AD will remain the mainstay in LMICs for the foreseeable future. Efforts should 
      be made towards the development of low-cost, easily administered risk assessment 
      tools to identify individuals who are at risk of AD in the population. We 
      recommend that stakeholders invest in education, research and development 
      targeted towards effective risk assessment and management.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aging world population accounts for the increasing 
      prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
      which carry a significant health and economic burden. There is therefore a need 
      for sensitive and specific noninvasive biomarkers for early diagnosis and 
      monitoring. Advances in retinal and optic nerve multimodal imaging as well as the 
      development of artificial intelligence deep learning systems (AI-DLS) have 
      heralded a number of promising advances of which ophthalmologists are at the 
      forefront. RECENT FINDINGS: The association among retinal vascular, nerve fiber 
      layer, and macular findings in neurodegenerative disease is well established. In 
      order to optimize the use of these ophthalmic parameters as biomarkers, validated 
      AI-DLS are required to ensure clinical efficacy and reliability. Varied image 
      acquisition methods and protocols as well as variability in neurogenerative 
      disease diagnosis compromise the robustness of ground truths that are paramount 
      to developing high-quality training datasets. SUMMARY: In order to produce 
      effective AI-DLS for the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disease, 
      multicenter international collaboration is required to prospectively produce 
      large inclusive datasets, acquired through standardized methods and protocols. 
      With a uniform approach, the efficacy of resultant clinical applications will be 
      maximized.

PG  - 393-418
LID - 10.1007/7854_2019_98 [doi]
AB  - This chapter reviews how recording and analysis of eye movements have been 
      applied to understanding cognitive functioning in patients with neurological 
      disease. Measures derived from the performance of instructed eye movement tests 
      such as the anti-saccade and memory-guided saccade tasks have been shown to be 
      associated with cognitive test performance and the early stages of 
      neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Other 
      researchers have taken an ecological approach and recorded the uninstructed 
      pattern of saccades made by patients during performance of established 
      neuropsychological tasks. Studies that have analysed the eye movement strategies 
      used in a number of widely used tests are reviewed, including the Corsi blocks, 
      Tower of London, 'CANTAB' Spatial Working Memory and Brixton Spatial Anticipation 
      test. The findings illustrate that eye movements are not purely in the service of 
      vision, but support visuospatial working memory and forward action planning. Eye 
      movement tests and measures also have potential for application in the assessment 
      and diagnosis of neurological disease and cognitive impairment. Establishing 
      large-scale normative data sets in healthy older adults and use of machine 
      learning multivariate classifier algorithms may be key to further developing eye 
      tracking applications in neuropsychological assessment.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) consists of the gradual process of decreasing volume and 
      quality of neuron connection in the brain, which consists of gradual synaptic 
      integrity and loss of cognitive functions. In recent years, there has been 
      significant attention in AD classification and early detection with machine 
      learning algorithms. There are different neuroimaging techniques for capturing 
      data and using it for the classification task. Input data as images will help 
      machine learning models to detect different biomarkers for AD classification. 
      This marker has a more critical role for AD detection than other diseases because 
      beta-amyloid can extract complex structures with some metal ions. Most 
      researchers have focused on using 3D and 4D convolutional neural networks for AD 
      classification due to reasonable amounts of data. Also, combination neuroimaging 
      techniques like functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission 
      tomography for AD detection have recently gathered much attention. However, 
      gathering a combination of data can be expensive, complex, and tedious. For time 
      consumption reasons, most patients prefer to throw one of the neuroimaging 
      techniques. So, in this review article, we have surveyed different research 
      studies with various neuroimaging techniques and ML methods to see the effect of 
      using combined data as input. The result has shown that the use of the 
      combination method would increase the accuracy of AD detection. Also, according 
      to the sensitivity metrics from different machine learning methods, MRI and fMRI 
      showed promising results.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range of 
      clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the central nervous 
      system leading to loss of brain function and eventual death. The most prevalent 
      of these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects approximately 50 million 
      people worldwide and is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative 
      diseases can only be fully diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological 
      assessment of the type and distribution of protein deposits which characterise 
      each different condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in 
      aiding patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these conditions for 
      many years. In this review, we consider the range of MR-based measurements and 
      describe the findings in AD, but also contrast these with the second most common 
      dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The most definitive observation is the 
      major structural brain changes seen in AD using conventional T1-weighted (T1w) 
      MRI, where medial temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most 
      symptomatic patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings 
      are sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic 
      criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in tissue 
      microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional 
      anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter structures. There are 
      suggestions that there are subtle differences between AD and DLB populations. At 
      the metabolic level, atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of 
      healthy neurons in brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to 
      show higher deposits of pathogenic proteins. As studies have moved from patients 
      with advanced disease and clear dysfunction to patients with earlier presentation 
      such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some represents the first 
      signs of their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to detect differences has 
      been weaker and further work is still required, ideally in much larger cohorts 
      than previously studied. The vast majority of imaging research in dementia 
      populations has been univariate with respect to the MR-derived parameters 
      considered. To date, none of these measurements has uniquely replicated the 
      patterns of tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, and the ability of MR 
      techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. Future opportunities 
      may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches (position emission 
      tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of structural and metabolic 
      changes. Such developments will require multi-variate analyses, possibly combined 
      with artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms, to enhance our ability 
      to combine the array of image-derived information, genetic, gender and lifestyle 
      factors.

AB  - Dementia, a chronic and progressive cognitive declination of brain function 
      caused by disease or impairment, is becoming more prevalent due to the aging 
      population. A major challenge in dementia is achieving accurate and timely 
      diagnosis. In recent years, neuroimaging with computer-aided algorithms have made 
      remarkable advances in addressing this challenge. The success of these approaches 
      is mostly attributed to the application of machine learning techniques for 
      neuroimaging. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 
      automated diagnostic approaches for dementia using medical image analysis and 
      machine learning algorithms published in the recent years. Based on the rigorous 
      review of the existing works, we have found that, while most of the studies 
      focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent research has demonstrated reasonable 
      performance in the identification of other types of dementia remains a major 
      challenge. Multimodal imaging analysis deep learning approaches have shown 
      promising results in the diagnosis of these other types of dementia. The main

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose is to review the latest advances of brain imaging 
      for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). RECENT FINDINGS: Brain imaging 
      techniques provide valuable and complementary information to support the 
      diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in clinical and research settings. The recent FDA 
      accelerated approvals of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab made amyloid-PET 
      critical in helping determine the optimal window for anti-amyloid therapeutic 
      interventions. Tau-PET, on the other hand, is considered of key importance for 
      the tracking of disease progression and for monitoring therapeutic interventions 
      in clinical trials. PET imaging for microglial activation, astrocyte reactivity 
      and synaptic degeneration are still new techniques only used in the research 
      field, and more studies are needed to validate their use in the clinical 
      diagnosis of AD. Finally, artificial intelligence has opened new prospective in 
      the early detection of AD using MRI modalities. SUMMARY: Brain imaging techniques 
      using PET improve our understanding of the different AD-related pathologies and 
      their relationship with each other along the course of disease. With more robust 
      validation, machine learning and deep learning algorithms could be integrated 
      with neuroimaging modalities to serve as valuable tools for clinicians to make 
      early diagnosis and prognosis of AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Authors have been advocating the research ideology that a 
      computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system trained using lots of patient data and 
      physiological signals and images based on adroit integration of advanced signal 
      processing and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning techniques in an 
      automated fashion can assist neurologists, neurosurgeons, radiologists, and other 
      medical providers to make better clinical decisions. SUMMARY: This paper presents 
      a state-of-the-art review of research on automated diagnosis of 5 neurological 
      disorders in the past 2 decades using AI techniques: epilepsy, Parkinson's 
      disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and ischemic brain stroke using 
      physiological signals and images. Recent research articles on different feature 
      extraction methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, feature selection, and 
      classification techniques are reviewed. Key Message: CAD systems using AI and 
      advanced signal processing techniques can assist clinicians in analyzing and 
      interpreting physiological signals and images more effectively.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in developed 
      countries. From a research point of view, impressive results have been reported 
      using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no practical diagnostic method is 
      available. In recent years, deep models have become popular, especially in 
      dealing with images. Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable 
      attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this 
      area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more 
      accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. 
      Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it 
      requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain 
      patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep 
      learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out 
      the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers 
      and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary 
      pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data 
      originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies. Deep models and 
      their performance are described in detail. Although deep learning has achieved 
      notable performance in detecting AD, there are several limitations, especially 
      regarding the availability of datasets and training procedures.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence, Speech, and Language Processing Approaches to Monitoring 
      Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1547-1574
LID - 10.3233/JAD-200888 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's 
      disease, as it declines concurrently with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech 
      and language data have been extensively studied in connection with its diagnosis. 
      OBJECTIVE: Firstly, to summarize the existing findings on the use of artificial 
      intelligence, speech, and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the 
      context of Alzheimer's disease. Secondly, to detail current research procedures, 
      highlight their limitations, and suggest strategies to address them. METHODS: 
      Systematic review of original research between 2000 and 2019, registered in 
      PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered six 
      databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed 
      and Embase), and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened 
      until December 2019. RESULTS: From 3,654 search results, 51 articles were 
      selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarize their findings: 
      study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods, and 
      outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, 
      availability, and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature 
      generation, machine learning, evaluation, and results), and clinical 
      applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias, and 
      strengths/limitations). CONCLUSION: Promising results are reported across nearly 
      all 51 studies, but very few have been implemented in clinical research or 
      practice. The main limitations of the field are poor standardization, limited 
      comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and 
      clinical applications. Active attempts to close these gaps will support 
      translation of future research into clinical practice.

AB  - The neuroimaging method of multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can 
      identify the changes in brain structure and function caused by Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) at different stages, and it is a practical method to study the 
      mechanism of AD progression. This paper reviews the studies of methods and 
      biomarkers for predicting AD progression based on multimodal MRI. First, 
      different approaches for predicting AD progression are analyzed and summarized, 
      including machine learning, deep learning, regression, and other MRI analysis 
      methods. Then, the effective biomarkers of AD progression under structural 
      magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging, and arterial spin labeling modes of MRI are summarized. It is 
      believed that the brain changes shown on MRI may be related to the cognitive 
      decline in different prodrome stages of AD, which is conducive to the further 
      realization of early intervention and prevention of AD. Finally, the deficiencies 
      of the existing studies are analyzed in terms of data set size, data 
      heterogeneity, processing methods, and research depth. More importantly, future 
      research directions are proposed, including enriching data sets, simplifying 
      biomarkers, utilizing multimodal magnetic resonance, etc. In the future, the 
      study of AD progression by multimodal MRI will still be a challenge but also a 
      significant research hotspot.

TI  - Transfer Learning for Alzheimer's Disease through Neuroimaging Biomarkers: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/s21217259 [doi]
LID - 7259
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a remarkable challenge for healthcare in the 21st 
      century. Since 2017, deep learning models with transfer learning approaches have 
      been gaining recognition in AD detection, and progression prediction by using 
      neuroimaging biomarkers. This paper presents a systematic review of the current 
      state of early AD detection by using deep learning models with transfer learning 
      and neuroimaging biomarkers. Five databases were used and the results before 
      screening report 215 studies published between 2010 and 2020. After screening, 13 
      studies met the inclusion criteria. We noted that the maximum accuracy achieved 
      to date for AD classification is 98.20% by using the combination of 3D 
      convolutional networks and local transfer learning, and that for the prognostic 
      prediction of AD is 87.78% by using pre-trained 3D convolutional network-based 
      architectures. The results show that transfer learning helps researchers in 
      developing a more accurate system for the early diagnosis of AD. However, there 
      is a need to consider some points in future research, such as improving the 
      accuracy of the prognostic prediction of AD, exploring additional biomarkers such 
      as tau-PET and amyloid-PET to understand highly discriminative feature 
      representation to separate similar brain patterns, managing the size of the 
      datasets due to the limited availability.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Brain disorders are one of the major global mortality 
      issues, and their early detection is crucial for healing. Machine learning, 
      specifically deep learning, is a technology that is increasingly being used to 
      detect and diagnose brain disorders. Our objective is to provide a quantitative 
      bibliometric analysis of the field to inform researchers about trends that can 
      inform their Research directions in the future. METHODS: We carried out a 
      bibliometric analysis to create an overview of brain disorder detection and 
      diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning. Our bibliometric analysis 
      includes 1550 articles gathered from the Scopus database on automated brain 
      disorder detection and diagnosis using machine learning and deep learning 
      published from 2015 to May 2023. A thorough bibliometric análisis is carried out 
      with the help of Biblioshiny and the VOSviewer platform. Citation analysis and 
      various measures of collaboration are analyzed in the study. RESULTS: According 
      to a study, maximum research is reported in 2022, with a consistent rise from 
      preceding years. The majority of the authors referenced have concentrated on 
      multiclass classification and innovative convolutional neural network models that 
      are effective in this field. A keyword analysis revealed that among the several 
      brain disorder types, Alzheimer's, autism, and Parkinson's disease had received 
      the greatest attention. In terms of both authors and institutes, the USA, China, 
      and India are among the most collaborating countries. We built a future research 
      agenda based on our findings to help progress research on machine learning and 
      deep learning for brain disorder detection and diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In summary, 
      our quantitative bibliometric analysis provides useful insights about trends in 
      the field and points them to potential directions in applying machine learning 
      and deep learning for brain disorder detection and diagnosis.</P>.

      Intelligence.
PG  - 2389-2401

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that primarily affects 
      brain tissue. Because the retina and brain share the same embryonic origin, 
      visual deficits have been reported in AD patients. Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
      has recently received a lot of attention due to its immense power to process and 
      detect image hallmarks and make clinical decisions (like diagnosis) based 
      on images. Since retinal changes have been reported in AD patients, AI is being 
      proposed to process images to predict, diagnose, and prognosis AD. As a result, 
      the purpose of this review was to discuss the use of AI trained on retinal images 
      of AD patients. According to previous research, AD patients experience retinal 
      thickness and retinal vessel density changes, which can occasionally occur before 
      the onset of the disease's clinical symptoms. AI and machine vision can detect 
      and use these changes in the domains of disease prediction, diagnosis, and 
      prognosis. As a result, not only have unique algorithms been developed for this 
      condition, but also databases such as the Retinal OCTA Segmentation dataset 
      (ROSE) have been constructed for this purpose. The achievement of high accuracy, 
      sensitivity, and specificity in the classification of retinal images between AD 
      and healthy groups is one of the major breakthroughs in using AI based on retinal 
      images for AD. It is fascinating that researchers could pinpoint individuals with 
      a positive family history of AD based on the properties of their eyes. In 
      conclusion, the growing application of AI in medicine promises its future 
      position in processing different aspects of patients with AD, but we need cohort 
      studies to determine whether it can help to follow up with healthy persons at 
      risk of AD for a quicker diagnosis or assess the prognosis of patients with AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological condition that affects millions of 
      individuals around the world and for which there are few effective therapies. 
      Dementia is characterized by the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary 
      tangles, which is followed by neurotoxicity, which results in memory loss and 
      mortality. Pathogenesis occurs several years before the onset of disease. As the 
      disease-modifying drugs are most effective in the early stages of Alzheimer's 
      disease, biomarkers for early detection of disease and their development are 
      crucial. This review discusses the diagnostic utility, benefits, and limitations 
      of traditional techniques such as neuroimaging, cognitive testing, positron 
      emission tomography, and biomarkers, as well as the novel techniques such as 
      artificial intelligence, machine learning, immunotherapy, and blood test 
      approaches for early detection, understanding, and treatment of AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common health problem in elderly people. There has 
      been considerable research toward the diagnosis and early detection of this 
      disease in the past decade. The sensitivity of biomarkers and the accuracy of the 
      detection techniques have been defined to be the key to an accurate diagnosis. 
      This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of the research performed on the 
      diagnosis of AD based on imaging and machine learning techniques. Different 
      segmentation and machine learning techniques used for the diagnosis of AD are 
      reviewed including thresholding, supervised and unsupervised learning, 
      probabilistic techniques, Atlas-based approaches, and fusion of different image 
      modalities. More recent and powerful classification techniques such as the 
      enhanced probabilistic neural network of Ahmadlou and Adeli should be 
      investigated with the goal of improving the diagnosis accuracy. A combination of 
      different image modalities can help improve the diagnosis accuracy rate. Research 
      is needed on the combination of modalities to discover multi-modal biomarkers.

AB  - Machine learning and data mining approaches are being successfully applied to 
      different fields of life sciences for the past 20 years. Medicine is one of the 
      most suitable application domains for these techniques since they help model 
      diagnostic information based on causal and/or statistical data and therefore 
      reveal hidden dependencies between symptoms and illnesses. In this paper we give 
      a detailed overview of the recent machine learning research and its applications 
      for predicting cognitive diseases, especially the Alzheimer's disease, mild 
      cognitive impairment and the Parkinson's disease. We survey different 
      state-of-the-art methodological approaches, data sources and public data, and 
      provide their comparative analysis. We conclude by identifying the open problems 
      within the field that include an early detection of the cognitive diseases and 
      inclusion of machine learning tools into diagnostic practice and therapy 
      planning.

AB  - Brain aging is a complex process that includes atrophy, vascular injury, and a 
      variety of age-associated neurodegenerative pathologies, together determining an 
      individual's course of cognitive decline. While Alzheimer's disease and related 
      dementias contribute to the heterogeneity of brain aging, these conditions 
      themselves are also heterogeneous in their clinical presentation, progression, 
      and pattern of neural injury. We reviewed studies that leveraged data-driven 
      approaches to examining heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease and related 
      dementias, with a principal focus on neuroimaging studies exploring subtypes of 
      regional neurodegeneration patterns. Over the past decade, the steadily 
      increasing wealth of clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular biomarker information 
      collected within large-scale observational cohort studies has allowed for a 
      richer understanding of the variability of disease expression within the aging 
      and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias continuum. Moreover, the 
      availability of these large-scale datasets has supported the development and 
      increasing application of clustering techniques for studying disease 
      heterogeneity in a data-driven manner. In particular, data-driven studies have 
      led to new discoveries of previously unappreciated disease subtypes characterized 
      by distinct neuroimaging patterns of regional neurodegeneration, which are 
      paralleled by heterogeneous profiles of pathological, clinical, and molecular 
      biomarker characteristics. Incorporating these findings into novel frameworks for 
      more differentiated disease stratification holds great promise for improving 
      individualized diagnosis and prognosis of expected clinical progression, and 
      provides opportunities for development of precision medicine approaches for 
      therapeutic intervention. We conclude with an account of the principal challenges 
      associated with data-driven heterogeneity analyses and outline avenues for future 
      developments in the field.

AB  - As the world's population ages, Alzheimer's disease is currently the seventh most 
      common cause of death globally; the burden is anticipated to increase, especially 
      among middle-class and elderly persons. Artificial intelligence-based algorithms 
      that work well in hospital environments can be used to identify Alzheimer's 
      disease. A number of databases were searched for English- language articles 
      published up until March 1, 2024, that examined the relationships between 
      artificial intelligence techniques, eye movements, and Alzheimer's disease. A 
      novel non-invasive method called eye movement analysis may be able to reflect 
      cognitive processes and identify anomalies in Alzheimer's disease. Artificial 
      intelligence, particularly deep learning, and machine learning, is required to 
      enhance Alzheimer's disease detection using eye movement data. One sort of deep 
      learning technique that shows promise is convolutional neural networks, which 
      need further data for precise classification. Nonetheless, machine learning 
      models showed a high degree of accuracy in this context. Artificial 
      intelligence-driven eye movement analysis holds promise for enhancing clinical 
      evaluations, enabling tailored treatment, and fostering the development of early 
      and precise Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. A combination of artificial 
      intelligence-based systems and eye movement analysis can provide a window for 
      early and non-invasive diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Despite ongoing 
      difficulties with early Alzheimer's disease detection, this presents a novel 
      strategy that may have consequences for clinical evaluations and customized 
      medication to improve early and accurate diagnosis.

AB  - Initial development of artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) 
      dates back to the mid-twentieth century. A growing awareness of the potential for 
      AI, as well as increases in computational resources, research, and investment are 
      rapidly advancing AI applications to medical imaging and, specifically, brain 
      molecular imaging. AI/ML can improve imaging operations and decision making, and 
      potentially perform tasks that are not readily possible by physicians, such as 
      predicting disease prognosis, and identifying latent relationships from 
      multi-modal clinical information. The number of applications of image-based AI 
      algorithms, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), is increasing rapidly. 
      The applications for brain molecular imaging (MI) include image denoising, PET 
      and PET/MRI attenuation correction, image segmentation and lesion detection, 
      parametric image formation, and the detection/diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease 
      and other brain disorders. When effectively used, AI will likely improve the 
      quality of patient care, instead of replacing radiologists. A regulatory 
      framework is being developed to facilitate AI adaptation for medical imaging.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Detection of neurological conditions is of high importance in the 
      current context of increasingly ageing populations. Imaging of the retina and the 
      optic nerve head represents a unique opportunity to detect brain diseases, but 
      requires specific human expertise. We review the current outcomes of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) methods applied to retinal imaging for the detection of 
      neurological and neuro-ophthalmic conditions. METHOD: Current and emerging 
      concepts related to the detection of neurological conditions, using AI-based 
      investigations of the retina in patients with brain disease were examined and 
      summarised. RESULTS: Papilloedema due to intracranial hypertension can be 
      accurately identified with deep learning on standard retinal imaging at a human 
      expert level. Emerging studies suggest that patients with Alzheimer's disease can 
      be discriminated from cognitively normal individuals, using AI applied to retinal 
      images. CONCLUSION: Recent AI-based systems dedicated to scalable retinal imaging 
      have opened new perspectives for the detection of brain conditions directly or 
      indirectly affecting retinal structures. However, further validation and 
      implementation studies are required to better understand their potential value in 
      clinical practice.

AB  - 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a useful 
      paraclinical exam for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this 
      narrative review, we report seminal studies in clinically probable AD that have 
      shown the importance of posterior brain metabolic decrease and the paradoxical 
      variability of the hippocampal metabolism. The FDG-PET pattern was a sensitive 
      indicator of AD in pathologically confirmed cases and it was used for 
      differential diagnosis of dementia conditions. In prodromal AD, the AD FDG-PET 
      pattern was observed in converters and predicted conversion. Automated data 
      analysis techniques provided variable accuracy according to the reported indices 
      and machine learning methods showed variable reliability of results. FDG-PET 
      could confirm AD clinical heterogeneity and image data driven analyses identified 
      hypometabolic subtypes with variable involvement of the hippocampus, reminiscent 
      if the paradoxical FDG uptake. In studies dedicated to clinical and metabolic 
      correlations, episodic memory was related to metabolism in the default mode 
      network (and Papez's circuit) in prodromal and mild AD stages, and specific 
      cognitive processes were associated to precisely distributed brain metabolism. 
      Cerebral metabolic correlates of anosognosia could also be related to current 
      neuropsychological models. AD FDG-PET pattern was reported in preclinical AD 
      stages and related to cognition or to conversion to mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI). Using other biomarkers, the AD FDG-PET pattern was confirmed in AD 
      participants with positive PET-amyloid. Intriguing observations reported 
      increased metabolism related to brain amyloid and/or tau deposition. Preserved 
      glucose metabolism sometimes appear as a compensation, but it was frequently 
      detrimental and the nature of such a preservation of glucose metabolism remains 
      an open question. Limbic metabolic involvement was frequently related to non-AD 
      biomarkers profile and clinical stability, and it was reported in non-AD 
      pathologies, such as the limbic predominant age-related encephalopathy (LATE). 
      FDG-PET abnormalities observed in the absence of classical AD proteinopathies can 
      be useful to search for pathological mechanisms and differential diagnosis of AD.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science with a variety of 
      subfields and techniques, exploited to serve as a deductive tool that performs 
      tasks originally requiring human cognition. AI tools and its subdomains are being 
      incorporated into healthcare delivery for the improvement of medical data 
      interpretation encompassing clinical management, diagnostics, and prognostic 
      outcomes. In the field of neuroradiology, AI manifested through deep machine 
      learning and connected neural networks (CNNs) has demonstrated incredible 
      accuracy in identifying pathology and aiding in diagnosis and prognostication in 
      several areas of neurology and neurosurgery. In this literature review, we survey 
      the available clinical data highlighting the utilization of AI in the field of 
      neuroradiology across multiple neurological and neurosurgical subspecialties. In 
      addition, we discuss the emerging role of AI in neuroradiology, its strengths and 
      limitations, as well as future needs in strengthening its role in clinical 
      practice. Our review evaluated data across several subspecialties of neurology 
      and neurosurgery including vascular neurology, spinal pathology, traumatic brain 
      injury (TBI), neuro-oncology, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and 
      epilepsy. AI has established a strong presence within the realm of neuroradiology 
      as a successful and largely supportive technology aiding in the interpretation, 
      diagnosis, and even prognostication of various pathologies. More research is 
      warranted to establish its full scientific validity and determine its maximum 
      potential to aid in optimizing and providing the most accurate imaging 
      interpretation.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms have a huge influence on tackling research issues in the 
      field of medical image processing. It acts as a vital aid for the radiologists in 
      producing accurate results toward effective disease diagnosis. The objective of 
      this research is to highlight the importance of deep learning models in the 
      detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The main objective of this research is to 
      analyze different deep learning methods used for detecting AD. This study 
      examines 103 research articles published in various research databases. These 
      articles have been selected based on specific criteria to find the most relevant 
      findings in the field of AD detection. The review was carried out based on deep 
      learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent 
      Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transfer Learning (TL). To propose accurate methods 
      for the detection, segmentation, and severity grading of AD, the radiological 
      features need to be examined in greater depth. This review attempts to analyze 
      different deep learning methods applied for AD detection using neuroimaging 
      modalities like Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
      (MRI), etc. The focus of this review is restricted to deep learning works based 
      on radiological imaging data for AD detection. There are a few works that have 
      utilized other biomarkers to understand the effect of AD. Also, articles 
      published in English were alone considered for analysis. This work concludes by 
      highlighting the key research issues towards effective AD detection. Though 
      several methods have yielded promising results in AD detection, the progression 
      from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD need to be analyzed in greater depth 
      using DL models.

TI  - Application of machine learning in measurement of ageing and geriatric diseases: 
      a systematic review.
PG  - 841
LID - 10.1186/s12877-023-04477-x [doi]
LID - 841
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the ageing population continues to grow in many countries, the 
      prevalence of geriatric diseases is on the rise. In response, healthcare 
      providers are exploring novel methods to enhance the quality of life for the 
      elderly. Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable surge in the use of 
      machine learning in geriatric diseases and care. Machine learning has emerged as 
      a promising tool for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of these 
      conditions. Hence, our study aims to find out the present state of research in 
      geriatrics and the application of machine learning methods in this area. METHODS: 
      This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
      and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and focused on healthy ageing in 
      individuals aged 45 and above, with a specific emphasis on the diseases that 
      commonly occur during this process. The study mainly focused on three areas, that 
      are machine learning, the geriatric population, and diseases. Peer-reviewed 
      articles were searched in the PubMed and Scopus databases with inclusion criteria 
      of population above 45 years, must have used machine learning methods, and 
      availability of full text. To assess the quality of the studies, Joanna Briggs 
      Institute's (JBI) critical appraisal tool was used. RESULTS: A total of 70 papers 
      were selected from the 120 identified papers after going through title screening, 
      abstract screening, and reference search. Limited research is available on 
      predicting biological or brain age using deep learning and different supervised 
      machine learning methods. Neurodegenerative disorders were found to be the most 
      researched disease, in which Alzheimer's disease was focused the most. Among 
      non-communicable diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cancer, kidney 
      diseases, and cardiovascular diseases were included, and other rare diseases like 
      oral health-related diseases and bone diseases were also explored in some papers. 
      In terms of the application of machine learning, risk prediction was the most 
      common approach. Half of the studies have used supervised machine learning 
      algorithms, among which logistic regression, random forest, XG Boost were 
      frequently used methods. These machine learning methods were applied to a variety 
      of datasets including population-based surveys, hospital records, and digitally 
      traced data. CONCLUSION: The review identified a wide range of studies that 
      employed machine learning algorithms to analyse various diseases and datasets. 
      While the application of machine learning in geriatrics and care has been 
      well-explored, there is still room for future development, particularly in 
      validating models across diverse populations and utilizing personalized digital 
      datasets for customized patient-centric care in older populations. Further, we 
      suggest a scope of Machine Learning in generating comparable ageing indices such 
      as successful ageing index.

TI  - Prevalence and Diagnosis of Neurological Disorders Using Different Deep Learning 
      Techniques: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 49
LID - 10.1007/s10916-019-1519-7 [doi]
AB  - This paper dispenses an exhaustive review on deep learning techniques used in the 
      prognosis of eight different neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders such as 
      stroke, alzheimer, parkinson's, epilepsy, autism, migraine, cerebral palsy, and 
      multiple sclerosis. These diseases are critical, life-threatening and in most of 
      the cases may lead to other precarious human disorders. Deep learning techniques 
      are emerging soft computing technique which has been lucratively used to unravel 
      different real-life problems such as pattern recognition (Face, Emotion, and 
      Speech), traffic management, drug discovery, disease diagnosis, and network 
      intrusion detection. This study confers the discipline, frameworks, and 
      methodologies used by different deep learning techniques to diagnose different 
      human neurological disorders. Here, one hundred and thirty-six different articles 
      related to neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders diagnosed using different 
      deep learning techniques are studied. The morbidity and mortality rate of major 
      neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders has also been delineated. The 
      performance and publication trend of different deep learning techniques employed 
      in the investigation of these diseases has been examined and analyzed. Different 
      performance metrics like accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity have also been 
      examined. The research implication, challenges and the future directions related 
      to the study have also been highlighted. Eventually, the research breaches are 
      identified and it is witnessed that there is more scope in the diagnosis of 
      migraine, cerebral palsy and stroke using different deep learning models. 
      Likewise, there is a potential opportunity to use and explore the performance of 
      Restricted Boltzmann Machine, Deep Boltzmann Machine and Deep Belief Network for 
      diagnosis of different human neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The complication of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has made the development 
      of its therapeutic a challenging task. Even after decades of research, we have 
      achieved no more than a few years of symptomatic relief. The inability to 
      diagnose the disease early is the major hurdle behind its treatment. Several 
      studies have aimed to identify potential biomarkers that can be detected in body 
      fluids (CSF, blood, urine, etc.) or assessed by neuroimaging (i.e., PET and MRI). 
      However, the clinical implementation of these biomarkers is incomplete as they 
      cannot be validated. METHODS: This study aimed to overcome the limitation of 
      using artificial intelligence along with technical tools that have been 
      extensively investigated for AD diagnosis. For developing a promising artificial 
      intelligence strategy that can diagnose AD early, it is critical to supervise 
      neuropsychological outcomes and imaging-based readouts with a proper clinical 
      review. CONCLUSION: Profound knowledge, a large data pool, and detailed 
      investigations are required for the successful implementation of this tool. This 
      review will enlighten various aspects of early diagnosis of AD using artificial 
      intelligence.

TI  - Detection of Systemic Diseases From Ocular Images Using Artificial Intelligence: 
      A Systematic Review.
PG  - 126-139
LID - 10.1097/APO.0000000000000515 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Despite the huge investment in health care, there is still a lack of 
      precise and easily accessible screening systems. With proven associations to many 
      systemic diseases, the eye could potentially provide a credible perspective as a 
      novel screening tool. This systematic review aims to summarize the current 
      applications of ocular image-based artificial intelligence on the detection of 
      systemic diseases and suggest future trends for systemic disease screening. 
      METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on September 1, 2021, using 3 
      databases-PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science library. Date restrictions 
      were not imposed and search terms covering ocular images, systemic diseases, and 
      artificial intelligence aspects were used. RESULTS: Thirty-three papers were 
      included in this systematic review. A spectrum of target diseases was observed, 
      and this included but was not limited to cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, central 
      nervous system diseases, renal dysfunctions, and hepatological diseases. 
      Additionally, one- third of the papers included risk factor predictions for the 
      respective systemic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular image - based artificial 
      intelligence possesses potential diagnostic power to screen various systemic 
      diseases and has also demonstrated the ability to detect Alzheimer and chronic 
      kidney diseases at early stages. Further research is needed to validate these 
      models for real-world implementation.

AB  - Machine learning has been increasingly used to obtain individualized neuroimaging 
      signatures for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and response to treatment in 
      neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, it has contributed 
      to a better understanding of disease heterogeneity by identifying disease 
      subtypes with different brain phenotypic measures. In this review, we first 
      present a systematic literature overview of studies using machine learning and 
      multimodal magnetic resonance imaging to unravel disease heterogeneity in various 
      neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, 
      schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and multiple 
      sclerosis, as well as their potential in a transdiagnostic framework, where 
      neuroanatomical and neurobiological commonalities were assessed across diagnostic 
      boundaries. Subsequently, we summarize relevant machine learning methodologies 
      and their clinical interpretability. We discuss the potential clinical 
      implications of the current findings and envision future research avenues. 
      Finally, we discuss an emerging paradigm called dimensional neuroimaging 
      endophenotypes. Dimensional neuroimaging endophenotypes dissects the 
      neurobiological heterogeneity of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders 
      into low-dimensional yet informative, quantitative brain phenotypic 
      representations, serving as robust intermediate phenotypes (i.e., 
      endophenotypes), presumably reflecting the interplay of underlying genetic, 
      lifestyle, and environmental processes associated with disease etiology.

TI  - Passive digital markers for Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias: A 
      systematic evidence review.
PG  - 2966-2974
LID - 10.1111/jgs.18426 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The timely detection of Alzheimer's disease and other related 
      dementias (ADRD) is suboptimal. Digital data already stored in electronic health 
      records (EHR) offer opportunities for enhancing the timely detection of ADRD by 
      facilitating the development of passive digital markers (PDMs). We conducted a 
      systematic evidence review to identify studies that describe the development, 
      performance, and validity of EHR-based PDMs for ADRD. METHODS: We searched the 
      literature published from January 2000 to August 2022 and reviewed 
      cross-sectional, retrospective, or prospective observational studies with a 
      patient population of 18 years or older, published in English that collected and 
      interpreted original data, included EHR as a source of digital data, and had the 
      primary purpose of supporting ADRD care. We extracted relevant data from the 
      included studies with guidance from the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction 
      for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist and used the US 
      Preventive Services Task Force criteria to appraise each study. RESULTS: We 
      included and appraised 19 studies. Four studies were considered to have a fair 
      quality, and none was considered to have a good quality. The functionality of the 
      PDMs varied from detecting mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease or 
      ADRD, to forecasting stages of ADRD. Only seven studies used a valid reference 
      diagnostic method. Nine PDMs used only structured EHR data, and five studies 
      provided complete information on the race and ethnicity of its population. The 
      number of features included in the PDMs ranges from 10 to 853, and the PMDs used 
      a variety of statistical and machine learning algorithms with various 
      time-at-risk windows. The area under the curve (AUC) for the PDMs varied from 
      0.67 to 0.97. CONCLUSION: Although we noted heterogeneity in the PDMs development 
      and performance, there is evidence that these PDMs have the potential to detect 
      ADRD at earlier stages.

TI  - Machine learning and microsimulation techniques on the prognosis of dementia: A 
      systematic literature review.
PG  - e0179804

LID - e0179804
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a complex disorder characterized by poor outcomes for the 
      patients and high costs of care. After decades of research little is known about 
      its mechanisms. Having prognostic estimates about dementia can help researchers, 
      patients and public entities in dealing with this disorder. Thus, health data, 
      machine learning and microsimulation techniques could be employed in developing 
      prognostic estimates for dementia. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this paper is to 
      present evidence on the state of the art of studies investigating and the 
      prognosis of dementia using machine learning and microsimulation techniques. 
      METHOD: To achieve our goal we carried out a systematic literature review, in 
      which three large databases-Pubmed, Socups and Web of Science were searched to 
      select studies that employed machine learning or microsimulation techniques for 
      the prognosis of dementia. A single backward snowballing was done to identify 
      further studies. A quality checklist was also employed to assess the quality of 
      the evidence presented by the selected studies, and low quality studies were 
      removed. Finally, data from the final set of studies were extracted in summary 
      tables. RESULTS: In total 37 papers were included. The data summary results 
      showed that the current research is focused on the investigation of the patients 
      with mild cognitive impairment that will evolve to Alzheimer's disease, using 
      machine learning techniques. Microsimulation studies were concerned with cost 
      estimation and had a populational focus. Neuroimaging was the most commonly used 
      variable. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction of conversion from MCI to AD is the dominant 
      theme in the selected studies. Most studies used ML techniques on Neuroimaging 
      data. Only a few data sources have been recruited by most studies and the ADNI 
      database is the one most commonly used. Only two studies have investigated the 
      prediction of epidemiological aspects of Dementia using either ML or MS 
      techniques. Finally, care should be taken when interpreting the reported accuracy 
      of ML techniques, given studies' different contexts.

TI  - Use of artificial intelligence techniques for detection of mild cognitive 
      impairment: A systematic scoping review.
PG  - 5752-5762
LID - 10.1111/jocn.16699 [doi]
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The objective of this scoping review is to explore the types 
      and mechanisms of Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for detecting mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI). BACKGROUND: Early detection of MCI is crucial because 
      it may progress to Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: A systematic scoping review. 
      METHODS: Five-step framework of Arksey and O'Malley was used following the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for 
      scoping reviews checklist. A total of 11 databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, 
      Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Explore, Science.gov, ACM digital 
      library, arXIV and ProQuest) was used to search from inception till 17th December 
      2021. Grey literature and reference list were searched. Articles screening and 
      data charting were conducted by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: There were a 
      total of 70 articles included from 2011 to 2022 across 16 countries. Four types 
      of AI techniques were found, namely machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), 
      fuzzy logic (FL) and technique combinations. Herein, ML detects similar pattern 
      within preselected data to classify subjects into non-MCI or MCI groups. 
      Meanwhile, DL performs classification based on data patterns and data analyses 
      are performed by themselves. Furthermore, FL utilises human-defined rules to 
      decide the degree to which a person has MCI. A combination of AI techniques 
      enhances the feature preparation phase for ML or DL to perform accurate 
      classification. CONCLUSION: Although AI-based MCI detection tool is critical for 
      healthcare decision-making, clinical utility and risks remain underexplored. 
      Hopefully, this review equips clinicians with background AI knowledge to address 
      these clinical concerns. Hence, future research should explore more techniques 
      and representative datasets to improve AI development. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL 
      PRACTICE: Results of this review can increase the knowledge of AI-based MCI 
      detection tools. REVIEW REGISTRATION: This study protocol was registered in the 
      Open Science Framework Registries (https://osf.io/45rdt).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex clinical phenotype with 
      unprecedented social and economic tolls on an ageing global population. 
      Real-world data (RWD) from electronic health records (EHRs) offer opportunities 
      to accelerate precision drug development and scale epidemiological research on 
      AD. A precise characterization of AD cohorts is needed to address the noise 
      abundant in RWD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study to develop 
      and test computational models for AD cohort identification using clinical data 
      from 8 Massachusetts healthcare systems. We mined temporal representations from 
      EHR data using the transitive sequential pattern mining algorithm (tSPM) to train 
      and validate our models. We then tested our models against a held-out test set 
      from a review of medical records to adjudicate the presence of AD. We trained two 
      classes of Machine Learning models, using Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), to 
      compare the utility of AD diagnosis records versus the tSPM temporal 
      representations (comprising sequences of diagnosis and medication observations) 
      from electronic medical records for characterizing AD cohorts. FINDINGS: In a 
      group of 4985 patients, we identified 219 tSPM temporal representations (i.e., 
      transitive sequences) of medical records for constructing the best classification 
      models. The models with sequential features improved AD classification by a 
      magnitude of 3-16 percent over the use of AD diagnosis codes alone. The computed 
      cohort included 663 patients, 35 of whom had no record of AD. Six groups of tSPM 
      sequences were identified for characterizing the AD cohorts. INTERPRETATION: We 
      present sequential patterns of diagnosis and medication codes from electronic 
      medical records, as digital markers of Alzheimer's Disease. Classification 
      algorithms developed on sequential patterns can replace standard features from 
      EHRs to enrich phenotype modelling. FUNDING: National Institutes of Health: the 
      National Institute on Aging (RF1AG074372) and the National Institute of Allergy 
      and Infectious Diseases (R01AI165535).

AB  - Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are among the most common 
      neurodegenerative disorders. These diseases are correlated with advancing age and 
      are hence increasingly becoming prevalent in developed countries due to an 
      increasingly aging demographic. Several tools are used to predict and diagnose 
      these diseases, including pathological and genetic tests, radiological scans, and 
      clinical examinations. Artificial intelligence is evolving to artificial general 
      intelligence, which mimics the human learning process. Large language models can 
      use an enormous volume of online and offline resources to gain knowledge and use 
      it to perform different types of tasks. This work presents an understanding of 
      two major neurodegenerative disorders, artificial general intelligence, and the 
      efficacy of using artificial general intelligence in detecting and predicting 
      these neurodegenerative disorders. A detailed discussion on detecting these 
      neurodegenerative diseases using artificial general intelligence by analyzing 
      diagnostic data is presented. An Internet of Things-based ubiquitous monitoring 
      and treatment framework is presented. An outline for future research 
      opportunities based on the challenges in this area is also presented.

      Analysis Based on Resting-State EEG Recordings: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 2130002
LID - 10.1142/S0129065721300023 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type 
      of dementia with a great prevalence in western countries. The diagnosis of AD and 
      its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures including 
      neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) 
      recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of 
      the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research 
      interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes 
      recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the correlation of 
      quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated by Mini Mental 
      State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental studies published from 
      2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms on resting state EEG 
      recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are 
      presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection 
      incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques have not 
      yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions for future studies 
      are presented.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is regarded as the foremost reason for 
      neurodegeneration that prominently affects the geriatric population. 
      Characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ), intracellular 
      aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), and neuronal degeneration that 
      causes impairment of memory and cognition. Amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration (ATN) 
      classification is utilized for research purposes and involves amyloid, tau, and 
      neuronal injury staging through MRI, PET scanning, and CSF protein concentration 
      estimations. CSF sampling is invasive, and MRI and PET scanning requires 
      sophisticated radiological facilities which limit its widespread diagnostic use. 
      ATN classification lacks effectiveness in preclinical AD. AREAS COVERED: This 
      publication intends to collate and review the existing biomarker profile and the 
      current research and development of a new arsenal of biomarkers for AD pathology 
      from different biological samples, microRNA (miRNA), proteomics, metabolomics, 
      artificial intelligence, and machine learning for AD screening, diagnosis, 
      prognosis, and monitoring of AD treatments. EXPERT OPINION: It is an accepted 
      observation that AD-related pathological changes occur over a long period of time 
      before the first symptoms are observed providing ample opportunity for detection 
      of biological alterations in various biological samples that can aid in early 
      diagnosis and modify treatment outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Emerging and advanced technologies in the field of Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) represent promising methods to predict and diagnose 
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. By using multimodal approaches, 
      Machine Learning (ML) seems to provide a better understanding of the pathological 
      mechanisms underlying the onset of dementia. The purpose of this review was to 
      discuss the current ML application in the field of neuropsychology and 
      electrophysiology, exploring its results in both prediction and diagnosis for 
      different forms of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Vascular Dementia 
      (VaD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD). 
      METHODS: Main ML-based papers focusing on neuropsychological assessments and 
      electroencephalogram (EEG) studies were analyzed for each type of dementia. 
      RESULTS: An accuracy ranging between 70 % and 90 % or even more was observed in 
      all neurophysiological and electrophysiological results trained by ML. Among all 
      forms of dementia, the most significant findings were observed for AD. Relevant 
      results were mostly related to diagnosis rather than prediction, because of the 
      lack of longitudinal studies with appropriate follow-up duration. However, it 
      remains unclear which ML algorithm performs better in diagnosing or predicting 
      dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological and electrophysiological measurements, 
      together with ML analysis, may be considered as reliable instruments for early 
      detection of dementia.

      metabolic syndrome-related biomarkers, as well as refine the assessment of 
      cardiovascular disease risk. Machine learning methods have also been applied to 
      assess new biomarkers and survival outcomes in patients with renal diseases to 
      predict the development of chronic kidney disease, disease progression, and renal 
      graft survival. In the latter, random forest methods were found to be the best 
      for the prediction of chronic kidney disease. Some studies have investigated the 
      prognosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and acute liver failure, as well as 
      therapy response prediction in patients with viral disorders, using decision tree 
      models. Machine learning techniques, such as Sparse High-Order Interaction Model 
      with Rejection Option, have been used for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease. Data 
      mining techniques have also been applied to identify the risk factors for serious 
      mental illness, such as depression and dementia, and help to diagnose and predict 
      the quality of life of such patients. In relation to child health, some studies 
      have determined the best algorithms for predicting obesity and malnutrition. 
      Machine learning has determined the important risk factors for preterm birth and 
      low birth weight. Published studies of patients with cancer and bacterial 
      diseases are limited and should perhaps be addressed more comprehensively in 
      future studies. Herein, we provide an in-depth review of studies in which 
      biochemical biomarker data were analyzed using machine learning methods to assess 
      the risk of several common diseases, in order to summarize the potential 
      applications of data mining methods in clinical diagnosis. Data mining techniques 
      have now been increasingly applied to clinical diagnostics, and they have the 
      potential to support this field.

AB  - Depression, a highly prevalent disorder affecting over 280 million people 
      worldwide, is comorbid with many neurological disorders, particularly Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Depression and AD share overlapping pathophysiology, and the search 
      for accountable biological substrates made it an essential and intriguing field 
      of research. The paper outlines the neurobiological pathways coinciding with 
      depression and AD, including neurotrophin signalling, the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), cellular apoptosis, neuroinflammation, 
      and other aetiological factors. Understanding overlapping pathways is crucial in 
      identifying common pathophysiological substrates that can be targeted for 
      effective management of disease state. Antidepressants, particularly 
      monoaminergic drugs (first-line therapy), are shown to have modest or no clinical 
      benefits. Regardless of the ineffectiveness of conventional antidepressants, 
      these drugs remain the mainstay for treating depressive symptoms in AD. To 
      overcome the ineffectiveness of traditional pharmacological agents in treating 
      comorbid conditions, a novel therapeutic class has been discussed in the paper. 
      This includes neurotransmitter modulators, glutamatergic system modulators, 
      mitochondrial modulators, antioxidant agents, HPA axis targeted therapy, 
      inflammatory system targeted therapy, neurogenesis targeted therapy, repurposed 
      anti-diabetic agents, and others. The primary clinical challenge is the 
      development of therapeutic agents and the effective diagnosis of the comorbid 
      condition for which no specific diagnosable scale is present. Hence, introducing 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare system is revolutionary. AI 
      implemented with interdisciplinary strategies (neuroimaging, EEG, molecular 
      biomarkers) bound to have accurate clinical interpretation of symptoms. Moreover, 
      AI has the potential to forecast neurodegenerative and psychiatric illness much 
      in advance before visible/observable clinical symptoms get precipitated.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review eXplainable Artificial Intelligence/(XAI) methods available 
      for medical imaging/(MI). METHOD: A scoping review was conducted following the 
      Joanna Briggs Institute's methodology. The search was performed on Pubmed, 
      Embase, Cinhal, Web of Science, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Google Scholar. Studies 
      published in French and English after 2017 were included. Keyword combinations 
      and descriptors related to explainability, and MI modalities were employed. Two 
      independent reviewers screened abstracts, titles and full text, resolving 
      differences through discussion. RESULTS: 228 studies met the criteria. XAI 
      publications are increasing, targeting MRI (n = 73), radiography (n = 47), CT 
      (n = 46). Lung (n = 82) and brain (n = 74) pathologies, Covid-19 (n = 48), 
      Alzheimer's disease (n = 25), brain tumors (n = 15) are the main pathologies 
      explained. Explanations are presented visually (n = 186), numerically (n = 67), 
      rule-based (n = 11), textually (n = 11), and example-based (n = 6). Commonly 
      explained tasks include classification (n = 89), prediction (n = 47), diagnosis 
      (n = 39), detection (n = 29), segmentation (n = 13), and image quality 
      improvement (n = 6). The most frequently provided explanations were local 
      (78.1 %), 5.7 % were global, and 16.2 % combined both local and global 
      approaches. Post-hoc approaches were predominantly employed. The used terminology 
      varied, sometimes indistinctively using explainable (n = 207), interpretable 
      (n = 187), understandable (n = 112), transparent (n = 61), reliable (n = 31), and 
      intelligible (n = 3). CONCLUSION: The number of XAI publications in medical 
      imaging is increasing, primarily focusing on applying XAI techniques to MRI, CT, 
      and radiography for classifying and predicting lung and brain pathologies. Visual 
      and numerical output formats are predominantly used. Terminology standardisation 
      remains a challenge, as terms like "explainable" and "interpretable" are 
      sometimes being used indistinctively. Future XAI development should consider user 
      needs and perspectives.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia worldwide, characterized 
      by heterogeneous neuropathological changes and progressive cognitive decline. 
      Despite the numerous studies, there are still no effective treatments beyond 
      those that aim to slow progression and compensate the impairment. Neuroimaging 
      techniques provide a comprehensive view of brain changes, with magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) playing a key role due to its non-invasive nature and wide 
      availability. The T1-weighted MRI sequence is frequently used due to its 
      prevalence in most MRI protocols, generating large datasets, ideal for artificial 
      intelligence (AI) applications. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep 
      learning (DL) techniques, has been increasingly utilized to model these datasets 
      and classify individuals along the AD continuum. This systematic review evaluates 
      studies using AI to classify more than two stages of AD based on T1-weighted MRI 
      data. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the most widely applied, achieving 
      an average classification accuracy of 85.93 % (range: 51.80-100 %; median: 
      87.70 %). These good results are due to CNNs' ability to extract hierarchical 
      features directly from raw imaging data, reducing the need for extensive 
      preprocessing. Non-convolutional neural networks and traditional ML approaches 
      also demonstrated strong performance, with mean accuracies of 82.50 % (range: 
      57.61-99.38 %; median: 86.67 %) and 84.22 % (range: 33-99.10 %; median: 87.75 %), 
      respectively, underscoring importance of input data selection. Despite promising 
      outcomes, challenges remain, including methodological heterogeneity, overfitting 
      risks, and a reliance on the ADNI database, which limits dataset diversity. 
      Addressing these limitations is critical to advancing AI's clinical application 
      for early detection, improved classification, and enhanced patient outcomes.

AB  - Textual Emotion Detection (TED) is a rapidly growing area in Natural Language 
      Processing (NLP) that aims to detect emotions expressed through text. In this 
      paper, we provide a review of the latest research and development in TED as 
      applied in health and medicine. We focus on medical and non-medical data types, 
      use cases, and methods where TED has been integral in supporting decision-making. 
      The application of NLP technologies in health, and particularly TED, requires 
      high confidence that these technologies and technology-aided treatment will 
      first, do no harm. Therefore, this review also aims to assess the accuracy of TED 
      systems and provide an update on the state of the technology. The Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines 
      were used in this review. With a specific focus on the identification of 
      different human emotions in text, the more general sentiment analysis studies 
      that only recognize the polarity of text were excluded. A total of 66 papers met 
      the inclusion criteria. This review found that TED in health and medicine is 
      mainly used in the detection of depression, suicidal ideation, and the mental 
      status of patients with asthma, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, and diabetes with 
      major data sources of social media, healthcare services, and counseling centers. 
      Approximately, 44% of the research in the domain is related to COVID-19, 
      investigating the public health response to vaccinations and the emotional 
      response of the public. In most cases, deep learning-based NLP techniques were 
      found to be preferred over other methods due to their superior performance. 
      Developing methods for implementing and evaluating dimensional emotional models, 
      resolving annotation challenges by utilizing health-related lexicons, and using 
      deep learning techniques for multi-faceted and real-time applications were found 
      to be among the main avenues for further development of TED applications in 
      health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review synthesizes the most recent neuroimaging 
      procedures and machine learning approaches for the prediction of conversion from 
      mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease dementia. METHODS: We 
      systematically searched PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases following 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      systematic review guidelines. RESULTS: Our search returned 2572 articles, 56 of 
      which met the criteria for inclusion in the final selection. The multimodality 
      framework and deep learning techniques showed potential for predicting the 
      conversion of MCI to AD dementia. CONCLUSION: Findings of this systematic review 
      identified that the possibility of using neuroimaging data processed by advanced 
      learning algorithms is promising for the prediction of AD progression. We also 
      provided a detailed description of the challenges that researchers are faced 
      along with future research directions. The protocol has been registered in the 
      International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews- CRD42019133402 and 
      published in the Systematic Reviews journal.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a silent disease that causes the brain cells to die 
      progressively, influencing consciousness, behavior, planning ability, and 
      language to name a few. AD increases exponentially with aging, where it doubles 
      every 5-6 years, causing profound implications, such as swallowing difficulties 
      and losing the ability to speak before death. According to the Ministry of Health 
      in Saudi Arabia, AD patients will triple by 2060 to reach 14 million patients 
      worldwide. The rapid rise of patients is caused by the silent progress of the 
      disease, leading to late diagnosis as the symptoms will not be distinguished from 
      normal aging affect. Moreover, with the current medical capabilities, it is 
      impossible to confirm AD with 100% certainty via specific medical examinations. 
      The literature review revealed that most recent publications used images to 
      diagnose AD, which is insufficient for local hospitals with limited imaging 
      capabilities. Other studies that used clinical and demographical data failed to 
      achieve adequate results. Consequently, this study aims to preemptively predict 
      AD in Saudi Arabia by employing machine learning (ML) techniques. The dataset was 
      acquired from King Fahad Specialist Hospital (KFSH) in Dammam, Saudi Arabia, 
      containing standard clinical tests for 152 patients. Four ML algorithms, namely, 
      support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), Adaptive Boosting 
      (AdaBoost), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to 
      preemptively diagnose the disease. The empirical results demonstrated the 
      robustness of SVM in the pre-emptive diagnosis of AD with accuracy, precision, 
      recall, and area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 95.56%, 
      94.70%, 97.78%, and 0.97, respectively, with 13 features after applying the 
      sequential forward feature selection technique. This model can assist the medical 
      staff in controlling the progression of the disease at low costs.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting 
      millions of people worldwide. Laboratory research and longitudinal clinical 
      studies have helped to reveal various information about the disease but the exact 
      causal process is not known yet. Patterns from alteration of neurochemicals 
      (e.g., glutathione depletion, etc.), hippocampal atrophy, and brain effective 
      connectivity loss as well as associated behavioral changes have generated 
      important characteristic features. These imaging-based readouts and 
      neuropsychological outcomes along with supervised clinical review are critical 
      for developing a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy for early 
      predictive AD diagnosis and therapeutic development.

AB  - Among the most critical health issues, brain illnesses, such as neurodegenerative 
      conditions and tumors, lower quality of life and have a significant economic 
      impact. Implantable technology and nano-drug carriers have enormous promise for 
      cerebral brain activity sensing and regulated therapeutic application in the 
      treatment and detection of brain illnesses. Flexible materials are chosen for 
      implantable devices because they help reduce biomechanical mismatch between the 
      implanted device and brain tissue. Additionally, implanted biodegradable devices 
      might lessen any autoimmune negative effects. The onerous subsequent operation 
      for removing the implanted device is further lessened with biodegradability. This 
      review expands on current developments in diagnostic technologies such as 
      magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, mass spectroscopy, infrared 
      spectroscopy, angiography, and electroencephalogram while providing an overview 
      of prevalent brain diseases. As far as we are aware, there hasn't been a single 
      review article that addresses all the prevalent brain illnesses. The reviewer 
      also looks into the prospects for the future and offers suggestions for the 
      direction of future developments in the treatment of brain diseases.

TI  - Role of Deep Learning in Predicting Aging-Related Diseases: A Scoping Review.
LID - 10.3390/cells10112924 [doi]
LID - 2924
AB  - Aging refers to progressive physiological changes in a cell, an organ, or the 
      whole body of an individual, over time. Aging-related diseases are highly 
      prevalent and could impact an individual's physical health. Recently, artificial 
      intelligence (AI) methods have been used to predict aging-related diseases and 
      issues, aiding clinical providers in decision-making based on patient's medical 
      records. Deep learning (DL), as one of the most recent generations of AI 
      technologies, has embraced rapid progress in the early prediction and 
      classification of aging-related issues. In this paper, a scoping review of 
      publications using DL approaches to predict common aging-related diseases (such 
      as age-related macular degeneration, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, 
      arthritis, Alzheimer's and lifestyle patterns related to disease progression), 
      was performed. Google Scholar, IEEE and PubMed are used to search DL papers on 
      common aging-related issues published between January 2017 and August 2021. These 
      papers were reviewed, evaluated, and the findings were summarized. Overall, 34 
      studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies indicate that DL could help 
      clinicians in diagnosing disease at its early stages by mapping diagnostic 
      predictions into observable clinical presentations; and achieving high predictive 
      performance (e.g., more than 90% accurate predictions of diseases in aging).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Its diagnosis and 
      progression detection have been intensively studied. Nevertheless, research 
      studies often have little effect on clinical practice mainly due to the following 
      reasons: (1) Most studies depend mainly on a single modality, especially 
      neuroimaging; (2) diagnosis and progression detection are usually studied 
      separately as two independent problems; and (3) current studies concentrate 
      mainly on optimizing the performance of complex machine learning models, while 
      disregarding their explainability. As a result, physicians struggle to interpret 
      these models, and feel it is hard to trust them. In this paper, we carefully 
      develop an accurate and interpretable AD diagnosis and progression detection 
      model. This model provides physicians with accurate decisions along with a set of 
      explanations for every decision. Specifically, the model integrates 11 modalities 
      of 1048 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
      real-world dataset: 294 cognitively normal, 254 stable mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI), 232 progressive MCI, and 268 AD. It is actually a two-layer model with 
      random forest (RF) as classifier algorithm. In the first layer, the model carries 
      out a multi-class classification for the early diagnosis of AD patients. In the 
      second layer, the model applies binary classification to detect possible 
      MCI-to-AD progression within three years from a baseline diagnosis. The 
      performance of the model is optimized with key markers selected from a large set 
      of biological and clinical measures. Regarding explainability, we provide, for 
      each layer, global and instance-based explanations of the RF classifier by using 
      the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) feature attribution framework. In 
      addition, we implement 22 explainers based on decision trees and fuzzy rule-based 
      systems to provide complementary justifications for every RF decision in each 
      layer. Furthermore, these explanations are represented in natural language form 
      to help physicians understand the predictions. The designed model achieves a 
      cross-validation accuracy of 93.95% and an F1-score of 93.94% in the first layer, 
      while it achieves a cross-validation accuracy of 87.08% and an F1-Score of 87.09% 
      in the second layer. The resulting system is not only accurate, but also 
      trustworthy, accountable, and medically applicable, thanks to the provided 
      explanations which are broadly consistent with each other and with the AD medical 
      literature. The proposed system can help to enhance the clinical understanding of 
      AD diagnosis and progression processes by providing detailed insights into the 
      effect of different modalities on the disease risk.

TI  - Machine Learning and Digital Biomarkers Can Detect Early Stages of 
      Neurodegenerative Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/s24051572 [doi]
LID - 1572
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's 
      Disease (PD) are devastating conditions that can develop without noticeable 
      symptoms, causing irreversible damage to neurons before any signs become 
      clinically evident. NDs are a major cause of disability and mortality worldwide. 
      Currently, there are no cures or treatments to halt their progression. Therefore, 
      the development of early detection methods is urgently needed to delay neuronal 
      loss as soon as possible. Despite advancements in Medtech, the early diagnosis of 
      NDs remains a challenge at the intersection of medical, IT, and regulatory 
      fields. Thus, this review explores "digital biomarkers" (tools designed for 
      remote neurocognitive data collection and AI analysis) as a potential solution. 
      The review summarizes that recent studies combining AI with digital biomarkers 
      suggest the possibility of identifying pre-symptomatic indicators of NDs. For 
      instance, research utilizing convolutional neural networks for eye tracking has 
      achieved significant diagnostic accuracies. ROC-AUC scores reached up to 0.88, 
      indicating high model performance in differentiating between PD patients and 
      healthy controls. Similarly, advancements in facial expression analysis through 
      tools have demonstrated significant potential in detecting emotional changes in 
      ND patients, with some models reaching an accuracy of 0.89 and a precision of 
      0.85. This review follows a structured approach to article selection, starting 
      with a comprehensive database search and culminating in a rigorous quality 
      assessment and meaning for NDs of the different methods. The process is 
      visualized in 10 tables with 54 parameters describing different approaches and 
      their consequences for understanding various mechanisms in ND changes. However, 
      these methods also face challenges related to data accuracy and privacy concerns. 
      To address these issues, this review proposes strategies that emphasize the need 
      for rigorous validation and rapid integration into clinical practice. Such 
      integration could transform ND diagnostics, making early detection tools more 
      cost-effective and globally accessible. In conclusion, this review underscores 
      the urgent need to incorporate validated digital health tools into mainstream 
      medical practice. This integration could indicate a new era in the early 
      diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, potentially altering the trajectory of 
      these conditions for millions worldwide. Thus, by highlighting specific and 
      statistically significant findings, this review demonstrates the current progress 
      in this field and the potential impact of these advancements on the global 
      management of NDs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurodegenerative diseases are chronic, currently incurable, diseases 
      of the elderly, which are characterized by protein misfolding and neuronal 
      damage. Fucoxanthin, derived from marine brown algae, presents a promising 
      candidate for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. HYPOTHESIS AND 
      PURPOSE: The relationship between neurodegenerative disease management and 
      fucoxanthin has not yet been clarified. This study focuses on the fundamental 
      mechanisms and targets of fucoxanthin in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease 
      management, showing that communication between the brain and the gut contributes 
      to neurodegenerative diseases and early diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases. This 
      paper also presents, new insights for future therapeutic directions based on the 
      integrated application of artificial intelligence. CONCLUSION: Fucoxanthin 
      primarily binds to amyloid fibrils with spreading properties such as Aβ, tau, and 
      α-synuclein to reduce their accumulation levels, alleviate inflammatory factors, 
      and restore mitochondrial membranes to prevent oxidative stress via Nrf2 and Akt 
      signaling pathways, involving reduction of specific secretases. In addition, 
      fucoxanthin may serve as a preventive diagnosis for neurodegenerative diseases 
      through ophthalmic disorders. It can modulate gut microbes and has potential for 
      the alleviation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with 
      phenotypic changes closely associated with both genetic variants and imaging 
      pathology. Brain imaging biomarker genomics has been developed in recent years to 
      reveal potential AD pathological mechanisms and provide early diagnoses. This 
      technique integrates multimodal imaging phenotypes with genetic data in a 
      noninvasive and high-throughput manner. In this review, we summarize the basic 
      analytical framework of brain imaging biomarker genomics and elucidate two main 
      implementation scenarios of this technique in AD studies: (1) exploring novel 
      biomarkers and seeking mutual interpretability and (2) providing a diagnosis and 
      prognosis for AD with combined use of machine learning methods and brain imaging 
      biomarker genomics. Importantly, we highlight the necessity of brain imaging 
      biomarker genomics, discuss the strengths and limitations of current methods, and 
      propose directions for development of this research field.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recently, longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's disease 
      have gathered a substantial amount of neuroimaging data. New methods are needed 
      to successfully leverage and distill meaningful information on the progression of 
      the disease from the deluge of available data. Machine learning has been used 
      successfully for many different tasks, including neuroimaging related problems. 
      In this paper, we review recent statistical and machine learning applications in 
      Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal neuroimaging. METHODS: We search for 
      papers using longitudinal imaging data, focused on Alzheimer's Disease and 
      published between 2007 and 2019 on four different search engines. RESULTS: After 
      the search, we obtain 104 relevant papers. We analyze their approach to typical 
      challenges in longitudinal data analysis, such as missing data and variability in 
      the number and extent of acquisitions. CONCLUSIONS: Reviewed works show that 
      machine learning methods using longitudinal data have potential for disease 
      progression modelling and computer-aided diagnosis. We compare results and 
      models, and propose future research directions in the field.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent cause of dementia, 
      characterized by a steady decline in mental, behavioral, and social abilities and 
      impairs a person's capacity for independent functioning. It is a fatal 
      neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting older adults. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this literature review is to investigate various AD detection 
      techniques, datasets, input modalities, algorithms, libraries, and performance 
      evaluation metrics used to determine which model or strategy may provide superior 
      performance. METHOD: The initial search yielded 807 papers, but only 100 research 
      articles were chosen after applying the inclusion-exclusion criteria. This SLR 
      analyzed research items published between January 2019 and December 2022. The 
      ACM, Elsevier, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, PubMed, Springer and Taylor & Francis 
      were systematically searched. The current study considers articles that used 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), APOe4 
      genotype, Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) 
      biomarkers. The study was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. CONCLUSION: According 
      to the literature survey, most studies (n = 76) used the DL strategy. The 
      datasets used by studies were primarily derived from the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The majority of studies (n = 73) used 
      single-modality neuroimaging data, while the remaining used multi-modal input 
      data. In a multi-modality approach, the combination of MRI and PET scans is 
      commonly preferred. Also, Regarding the algorithm used, Convolution Neural 
      Network (CNN) showed the highest accuracy, 100 %, in classifying AD vs. CN 
      subjects whereas the SVM was the most common ML algorithm, with a maximum 
      accuracy of 99.82 %.

AB  - Over the past decade, ocular imaging strategies have greatly advanced the 
      diagnosis and follow-up of patients with optic neuropathies. Developments in 
      optic nerve imaging have specifically improved the care of patients with 
      papilloedema and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, inflammatory optic 
      neuropathies, and compressive optic neuropathies. For example, optic nerve 
      imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) is now widely used as an outcome 
      measure in clinical trials of neurological disorders (eg, demyelinating 
      diseases), and OCT findings could be informative of disease progression in 
      patients with various neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Alzheimer's disease or 
      Parkinson's disease). In the past 5 years, multimodality optic nerve imaging has 
      expanded to systematically include focused and wide-field colour and 
      autofluorescence fundus photographs; various types of optic nerve, macular, and 
      vascular OCT; and specific MRI techniques. Such multimodality imaging makes the 
      diagnosis of optic neuropathies easier and provides objective information on 
      optic nerve damage, which is useful for prognosis. Non-mydriatic ocular fundus 
      cameras and OCT have become readily available in non-ophthalmic settings and 
      could easily be implemented in neurological clinics and emergency departments, 
      allowing for direct access to optic nerve imaging and enabling teleconsultations. 
      In the future, these imaging studies could be used in association with artificial 
      intelligence deep-learning systems, which are already transforming the field of 
      ocular imaging.

AB  - Imaging bio-markers have been widely used for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD) with Deep Learning (DL). However, the structural brain 
      atrophy is not detectable at an early stage of the disease (namely for Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Mild Alzheimer's Disease (MAD)). Indeed, potential 
      biological bio-markers have been proved their ability to early detect brain 
      abnormalities related to AD before brain structural damage and clinical 
      manifestation. Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) provides a 
      promising solution for biological brain changes detection in a no invasive 
      manner. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided supervised DL framework for 
      early AD detection using (1)H-MRS data. In the early stages of AD, features may 
      be closely related and often complex to delineate between subjects. Hence, we 
      develop a 1D attention mechanism that explicitly guides the classifier to focus 
      on diagnostically relevant metabolites for classes discrimination. Synthetic data 
      are used to tackle the lack of data problem and to help in learning the feature 
      space. Data used in this paper are collected in the University Hospital of 
      Poitiers, which contained 111 (1)H-MRS samples extracted from the Posterior 
      Cingulate Cortex (PCC) brain region. The data contain 33 Normal Control (NC), 49 
      MCI due to AD, and 29 MAD subjects. The proposed model achieves an average 
      classification accuracy of 95.23%. Our framework outperforms state of the art 
      imaging-based approaches, proving the robustness of learning metabolites features 
      against traditional imaging bio-markers for early AD detection.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a problem, owing to its high prevalence in an 
      aging society with no treatment available after onset. However, early diagnosis 
      is essential for preventive intervention to delay disease onset due to its slow 
      progression. The current AD diagnostic methods are typically invasive and 
      expensive, limiting their potential for widespread use. Thus, the development of 
      biomarkers in available biofluids, such as blood, urine, and saliva, which 
      enables low or non-invasive, reasonable, and objective evaluation of AD status, 
      is an urgent task. Here, we reviewed studies that examined biomarker candidates 
      for the early detection of AD. Some of the candidates showed potential 
      biomarkers, but further validation studies are needed. We also reviewed studies 
      for non-invasive biomarkers of AD. Given the complexity of the AD continuum, 
      multiple biomarkers with machine-learning-classification methods have been 
      recently used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and characterize individual AD 
      phenotypes. Artificial intelligence and new body fluid-based biomarkers, in 
      combination with other risk factors, will provide a novel solution that may 
      revolutionize the early diagnosis of AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects a significant portion of the aging 
      population, presenting a serious challenge due to the limited availability of 
      effective therapies during its progression. The disease advances rapidly, 
      underscoring the need for early diagnosis and the application of preventative 
      measures. Current diagnostic methods for AD are often expensive and invasive, 
      restricting access for the general public. One potential solution is the use of 
      biomarkers, which can facilitate early detection and treatment through objective, 
      non-invasive, and cost-effective evaluations of AD. This review critically 
      investigates the function and role of biofluid biomarkers in detecting AD, with a 
      specific focus on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood-based, and saliva biomarkers. 
      RESULTS: CSF biomarkers have demonstrated potential for accurate diagnosis and 
      valuable prognostic insights, while blood biomarkers offer a minimally invasive 
      and cost-effective approach for diagnosing cognitive issues. However, while 
      current biomarkers for AD show significant potential, none have yet achieved the 
      precision needed to replace expensive PET scans and CSF assays. The lack of a 
      single accurate biomarker underscores the need for further research to identify 
      novel or combined biomarkers to enhance the clinical efficacy of existing 
      diagnostic tests. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-learning 
      (DL) tools present promising avenues for improving biomarker analysis and 
      interpretation, enabling more precise and timely diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Further 
      research is essential to confirm the utility of all AD biomarkers in clinical 
      settings. Combining biomarker data with AI tools offers a promising path toward 
      revolutionizing the personalized characterization and early diagnosis of AD 
      symptoms.

AB  - A disease is an abnormal condition that negatively impacts the functioning of the 
      human body. Pathology determines the causes behind the disease and identifies its 
      development mechanism and functional consequences. Each disease has different 
      identification methods, including X-ray scans for pneumonia, covid-19, and lung 
      cancer, whereas biopsy and CT-scan can identify the presence of skin cancer and 
      Alzheimer's disease, respectively. Early disease detection leads to effective 
      treatment and avoids abiding complications. Deep learning has provided a vast 
      number of applications in medical sectors resulting in accurate and reliable 
      early disease predictions. These models are utilized in the healthcare industry 
      to provide supplementary assistance to doctors in identifying the presence of 
      diseases. Majorly, these models are trained through secondary data sources since 
      healthcare institutions refrain from sharing patients' private data to ensure 
      confidentiality, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning models due to 
      the requirement of extensive datasets for training to achieve optimal results. 
      Federated learning deals with the data in such a way that it doesn't exploit the 
      privacy of a patient's data. In this work, a wide variety of disease detection 
      models trained through federated learning have been rigorously reviewed. This 
      meta-analysis provides an in-depth review of the federated learning 
      architectures, federated learning types, hyperparameters, dataset utilization 
      details, aggregation techniques, performance measures, and augmentation methods 
      applied in the existing models during the development phase. The review also 
      highlights various open challenges associated with the disease detection models 
      trained through federated learning for future research.

TI  - The future of Alzheimer's disease risk prediction: a systematic review.
PG  - 3377-3390
LID - 10.1007/s10072-025-08167-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent kind of age-associated 
      dementia among older adults globally. Traditional diagnostic models for 
      predicting Alzheimer's disease risks primarily rely on demographic and clinical 
      data to develop policies and assess probabilities. However, recent advancements 
      in machine learning (ML) and other artificial intelligence (AI) have shown 
      promise in developing personalized risk models. These models use specific patient 
      data from medical imaging and related reports. In this systematic review, 
      different studies comprehensively examined the use of ML in magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI), genetics, radiomics, and medical data for Alzheimer's disease risk 
      assessment. I highlighted the results of our rigorous analysis of this research 
      and emphasized the exciting potential of ML methods for Alzheimer's disease risk 
      prediction. We also looked at current research projects and possible uses of 
      AI-driven methods to enhance Alzheimer's disease risk prediction and enable more 
      efficient investigating and individualized risk mitigation strategies. AIM AND 
      METHODS: This review integrates both conventional and AI-based models to 
      thoroughly analyze neuroimaging and non-neuroimaging features used in Alzheimer's 
      disease prediction. This study examined factors related to imaging, radiomics, 
      genetics, and clinical aspects. In addition, this study comprehensively presented 
      machine learning for predicting the risk of Alzheimer's disease detection to 
      benefit both beginner and expert researchers. RESULTS: A total of 700 
      publications from 2000 and 2024, were initially retrieved, out of which 120 
      studies met the inclusion criteria and were elected for review. The diagnosis of 
      neurological disorders, along with the application of deep learning (DL) and 
      machine learning (ML) were central themes in studies on the subject. When 
      analyzing the medical implementation or design of innovative models, various 
      machine learning models applied to neuroimaging and non-neuroimaging data may 
      help researchers and clinicians become more informed. This review provides an 
      extensive guide to the state of Alzheimer's disease risk assessment with 
      artificial AI. CONCLUSION: By integrating diverse neuroimaging and 
      non-neuroimaging data sources, this study provides researchers with an 
      alternative viewpoint on the application of AI in Alzheimer's disease risk 
      prediction emphasizing its potential to improve early diagnosis and personalized 
      intervention strategies.

AB  - Texture analysis is an emerging field that allows mathematical detection of 
      changes in MRI signals that are not visible among image pixels. Alzheimer's 
      disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is the most common cause of 
      dementia. Recently, multiple texture analysis studies in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease have been performed. This review summarizes the main 
      contributors to Alzheimer's disease-associated cognitive decline, presents a 
      brief overview of texture analysis, followed by review of various MR imaging 
      texture analysis applications in Alzheimer's disease. We also discuss the current 
      challenges for widespread clinical utilization. MR texture analysis could 
      potentially be applied to develop neuroimaging biomarkers for use in Alzheimer's 
      disease clinical trials and diagnosis.

TI  - A systematic survey of advances in retinal imaging modalities for Alzheimer's 
      disease diagnosis.
PG  - 2213-2243
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-00927-4 [doi]
AB  - Recent advances in retinal imaging pathophysiology have shown a new function for 
      biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and prognosis. The significant 
      improvements in Optical coherence tomography (OCT) retinal imaging have led to 
      significant clinical translation, particularly in Alzheimer's disease detection. 
      This systematic review will provide a comprehensive overview of retinal imaging 
      in clinical applications, with a special focus on biomarker analysis for use in 
      Alzheimer's disease detection. Articles on OCT retinal imaging in Alzheimer's 
      disease diagnosis were identified in PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and 
      Research Gate databases until March 2021. Those studies using simultaneous 
      retinal imaging acquisition were chosen, while those using sequential techniques 
      were rejected. "Alzheimer's disease" and "Dementia" were searched alone and in 
      combination with "OCT" and "retinal imaging". Approximately 1000 publications 
      were searched, and after deleting duplicate articles, 145 relevant studies 
      focused on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease utilizing retinal imaging were 
      chosen for study. OCT has recently been demonstrated to be a valuable technique 
      in clinical practice as according to this survey, 57% of the researchers employed 
      optical coherence tomography, 19% used ocular fundus imaging, 13% used scanning 
      laser ophthalmoscopy, and 11% have used multimodal imaging to diagnose Alzheimer 
      disease. Retinal imaging has become an important diagnostic technique for 
      Alzheimer's disease. Given the scarcity of available literature, it is clear that 
      future prospective trials involving larger and more homogeneous groups are 
      necessary, and the work can be expanded by evaluating its significance utilizing 
      a machine-learning platform rather than simply using statistical methodologies.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease has an increasing prevalence in the population world-wide, 
      yet current diagnostic methods based on recommended biomarkers are only available 
      in specialized clinics. Due to these circumstances, Alzheimer's disease is 
      usually diagnosed late, which contrasts with the currently available treatment 
      options that are only effective for patients at an early stage. Blood-based 
      biomarkers could fill in the gap of easily accessible and low-cost methods for 
      early diagnosis of the disease. In particular, immune-based blood-biomarkers 
      might be a promising option, given the recently discovered cross-talk of immune 
      cells of the central nervous system with those in the peripheral immune system. 
      Here, we give a background on recent advances in research on brain-immune system 
      cross-talk in Alzheimer's disease and review machine learning approaches, which 
      can combine multiple biomarkers with further information (e.g. age, sex, APOE 
      genotype) into predictive models supporting an earlier diagnosis. In addition, 
      mechanistic modeling approaches, such as agent-based modeling open the 
      possibility to model and analyze cell dynamics over time. This review aims to 
      provide an overview of the current state of immune-system related blood-based 
      biomarkers and their potential for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - In recent years, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful tool in clinical 
      imaging, offering unprecedented opportunities for the diagnosis and treatment of 
      neurological disorders (NDs). This comprehensive review explores the multifaceted 
      role of DL techniques in leveraging vast datasets to advance our understanding of 
      NDs and improve clinical outcomes. Beginning with a systematic literature review, 
      we delve into the utilization of DL, particularly focusing on multimodal 
      neuroimaging data analysis-a domain that has witnessed rapid progress and 
      garnered significant scientific interest. Our study categorizes and critically 
      analyses numerous DL models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), 
      LSTM-CNN, GAN, and VGG, to understand their performance across different types of 
      Neurology Diseases. Through particular analysis, we identify key benchmarks and 
      datasets utilized in training and testing DL models, shedding light on the 
      challenges and opportunities in clinical neuroimaging research. Moreover, we 
      discuss the effectiveness of DL in real-world clinical scenarios, emphasizing its 
      potential to revolutionize ND diagnosis and therapy. By synthesizing existing 
      literature and describing future directions, this review not only provides 
      insights into the current state of DL applications in ND analysis but also covers 
      the way for the development of more efficient and accessible DL techniques. 
      Finally, our findings underscore the transformative impact of DL in reshaping the 
      landscape of clinical neuroimaging, offering hope for enhanced patient care and 
      groundbreaking discoveries in the field of neurology. This review paper is 
      beneficial for neuropathologists and new researchers in this field.

TI  - Machine Learning Approaches for Dementia Detection Through Speech and Gait 
      Analysis: A Systematic Literature Review.
PG  - 1-27
LID - 10.3233/JAD-231459 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is a general term for several progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Timely and accurate detection is crucial 
      for early intervention. Advancements in artificial intelligence present 
      significant potential for using machine learning to aid in early detection. 
      OBJECTIVE: Summarize the state-of-the-art machine learning-based approaches for 
      dementia prediction, focusing on non-invasive methods, as the burden on the 
      patients is lower. Specifically, the analysis of gait and speech performance can 
      offer insights into cognitive health through clinically cost-effective screening 
      methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted following the 
      PRISMA protocol (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses). The search was performed on three electronic databases (Scopus, 
      Web of Science, and PubMed) to identify the relevant studies published between 
      2017 to 2022. A total of 40 papers were selected for review. RESULTS: The most 
      common machine learning methods employed were support vector machine followed by 
      deep learning. Studies suggested the use of multimodal approaches as they can 
      provide comprehensive and better prediction performance. Deep learning 
      application in gait studies is still in the early stages as few studies have 
      applied it. Moreover, including features of whole body movement contribute to 
      better classification accuracy. Regarding speech studies, the combination of 
      different parameters (acoustic, linguistic, cognitive testing) produced better 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights the potential of machine learning, 
      particularly non-invasive approaches, in the early prediction of dementia. The 
      comparable prediction accuracies of manual and automatic speech analysis indicate 
      an imminent fully automated approach for dementia detection.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most generally known neurodegenerative disorder, 
      leading to a steady deterioration in cognitive ability. Deep learning models have 
      shown outstanding performance in the diagnosis of AD, and these models do not 
      need any handcrafted feature extraction over conventional machine learning 
      algorithms. Since the 2012 AlexNet accomplishment, the convolutional neural 
      network (CNN) has been progressively utilized by the medical community to assist 
      practitioners to early diagnose AD. This paper explores the current cutting edge 
      applications of CNN on single and multimodality (combination of two or more 
      modalities) neuroimaging data for the classification of AD. An exhaustive 
      systematic search is conducted on four notable databases: Google Scholar, IEEE 
      Xplore, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed in June 2021. The objective of this study 
      is to examine the effectiveness of classification approaches on AD to analyze 
      different kinds of datasets, neuroimaging modalities, preprocessing techniques, 
      and data handling methods. However, CNN has achieved great success in the 
      classification of AD; still, there are a lot of challenges particularly due to 
      scarcity of medical imaging data and its possible scope in this field.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a serious neurological illness that causes memory 
      loss gradually by destroying brain cells. This deadly brain illness primarily 
      strikes the elderly, impairing their cognitive and bodily abilities until brain 
      shrinkage occurs. Modern techniques are required for an accurate diagnosis of AD. 
      Machine learning has gained attraction in the medical field as a means of 
      determining a person's risk of developing AD in its early stages. One of the most 
      advanced soft computing neural network-based Deep Learning (DL) methodologies has 
      garnered significant interest among researchers in automating early-stage AD 
      diagnosis. Hence, a comprehensive review is necessary to gain insights into DL 
      techniques for the advancement of more effective methods for diagnosing AD. This 
      review explores multiple biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and 
      various DL methodologies, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Convolutional 
      Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), The k-nearest-neighbor 
      (k-NN), Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), and Deep Belief Networks (DBN), which have 
      been employed for automating the early diagnosis of AD. Moreover, the unique 
      contributions of this review include the classification of ATN biomarkers for 
      Alzheimer's Disease (AD), systemic description of diverse DL algorithms for early 
      AD assessment, along with a discussion of widely utilized online datasets such as 
      ADNI, OASIS, etc. Additionally, this review provides perspectives on future 
      trends derived from critical evaluation of each variant of DL techniques across 
      different modalities, dataset sources, AUC values, and accuracies.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of magnetic resonance imaging-based machine learning in 
      Alzheimer's disease detection: a meta-analysis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms can assist rapid medical image 
      recognition and realize automatic, efficient, noninvasive, and convenient 
      diagnosis. We aim to further evaluate the diagnostic performance of ML to 
      distinguish patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) from normal older 
      adults based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The 
      Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for relevant 
      literature published up until July 2021. We used the Quality Assessment of 
      Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool and Checklist for Artificial 
      Intelligence in Medical Imaging (CLAIM) to evaluate all included studies' quality 
      and potential bias. Random-effects models were used to calculate pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity, and the Deeks' test was used to assess publication 
      bias. RESULTS: We included 24 models based on different brain features extracted 
      by ML algorithms in 19 papers. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and area 
      under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve for ML in detecting AD 
      were 0.85 (95%CI 0.81-0.89), 0.88 (95%CI 0.84-0.91), 7.15 (95%CI 5.40-9.47), 0.17 
      (95%CI 0.12-0.22), 43.34 (95%CI 26.89-69.84), and 0.93 (95%CI 0.91-0.95). 
      CONCLUSION: ML using structural MRI data performed well in diagnosing probable AD 
      patients and normal elderly. However, more high-quality, large-scale prospective 
      studies are needed to further enhance the reliability and generalizability of ML 
      for clinical applications before it can be introduced into clinical practice.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common disorder associated with cognitive 
      impairment. Recent observations emphasize the pathogenic role of multiple factors 
      inside and outside the central nervous system, supporting the notion that AD is a 
      syndrome of many etiologies rather than a "heterogeneous" but ultimately unifying 
      disease entity. Moreover, the defining pathology of amyloid and tau coexists with 
      many others, such as α-synuclein, TDP-43, and others, as a rule, not an 
      exception. Thus, an effort to shift our AD paradigm as an amyloidopathy must be 
      reconsidered. Along with amyloid accumulation in its insoluble state, β-amyloid 
      is becoming depleted in its soluble, normal states, as a result of biological, 
      toxic, and infectious triggers, requiring a shift from convergence to divergence 
      in our approach to neurodegeneration. These aspects are reflected-in vivo-by 
      biomarkers, which have become increasingly strategic in dementia. Similarly, 
      synucleinopathies are primarily characterized by abnormal deposition of misfolded 
      α-synuclein in neurons and glial cells and, in the process, depleting the levels 
      of the normal, soluble α-synuclein that the brain needs for many physiological 
      functions. The soluble to insoluble conversion also affects other normal brain 
      proteins, such as TDP-43 and tau, accumulating in their insoluble states in both 
      AD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The two diseases have been distinguished 
      by the differential burden and distribution of insoluble proteins, with 
      neocortical phosphorylated tau deposition more typical of AD and neocortical 
      α-synuclein deposition peculiar to DLB. We propose a reappraisal of the 
      diagnostic approach to cognitive impairment from convergence (based on 
      clinicopathologic criteria) to divergence (based on what differs across 
      individuals affected) as a necessary step for the launch of precision medicine.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative brain disorder that 
      degrades the memory and cognitive ability in elderly people. The main reason for 
      memory loss and reduction in cognitive ability is the structural changes in the 
      brain that occur due to neuronal loss. These structural changes are most 
      conspicuous in the hippocampus, cortex, and grey matter and can be assessed by 
      using neuroimaging techniques viz. Positron Emission Tomography (PET), structural 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), etc. Out of these 
      neuroimaging techniques, structural MRI has evolved as the best technique as it 
      indicates the best soft tissue contrast and high spatial resolution which is 
      important for AD detection. Currently, the focus of researchers is on predicting 
      the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) into AD. MCI represents the 
      transition state between expected cognitive changes with normal aging and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Not every MCI patient progresses into Alzheimer's disease. 
      MCI can develop into stable MCI (sMCI, patients are called non-converters) or 
      into progressive MCI (pMCI, patients are diagnosed as MCI converters). This paper 
      discusses the prognosis of MCI to AD conversion and presents a review of 
      structural MRI-based studies for AD detection. AD detection framework includes 
      feature extraction, feature selection, and classification process. This paper 
      reviews the studies for AD detection based on different feature extraction 
      methods and machine learning algorithms for classification. The performance of 
      various feature extraction methods has been compared and it has been observed 
      that the wavelet transform-based feature extraction method would give promising 
      results for AD classification. The present study indicates that researchers are 
      successful in classifying AD from Normal Controls (N(rm)C) but, it still requires 
      a lot of work to be done for MCI/ N(rm)C and MCI/AD, which would help in 
      detecting AD at its early stage.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major neurodegenerative disease and the most common 
      cause of dementia. Currently, no treatment exists to slow down or stop the 
      progression of AD. There is converging belief that disease-modifying treatments 
      should focus on early stages of the disease, that is, the mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) and preclinical stages. Making a diagnosis of AD and offering a 
      prognosis (likelihood of converting to AD) at these early stages are challenging 
      tasks but possible with the help of multimodality imaging, such as magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI), fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission topography 
      (PET), amyloid-PET, and recently introduced tau-PET, which provides different but 
      complementary information. This article is a focused review of existing research 
      in the recent decade that used statistical machine learning and artificial 
      intelligence methods to perform quantitative analysis of multimodality image data 
      for diagnosis and prognosis of AD at the MCI or preclinical stages. We review the 
      existing work in 3 subareas: diagnosis, prognosis, and methods for handling 
      modality-wise missing data-a commonly encountered problem when using 
      multimodality imaging for prediction or classification. Factors contributing to 
      missing data include lack of imaging equipment, cost, difficulty of obtaining 
      patient consent, and patient drop-off (in longitudinal studies). Finally, we 
      summarize our major findings and provide some recommendations for potential 
      future research directions.

TI  - The Feasibility of Early Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using a Neural Network 
      Hybrid Platform.
LID - 10.3390/bios12090753 [doi]
LID - 753
AB  - Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for disease prevention 
      and cure. However, currently, techniques with the required high sensitivity and 
      specificity are lacking. Recently, with the advances and increased accessibility 
      of data analysis tools, such as machine learning, research efforts have 
      increasingly focused on using these computational methods to solve this 
      challenge. Here, we demonstrate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD 
      diagnosis approach using the surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) 
      fingerprints of human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). SERS and CNN were combined for 
      biomarker detection to analyze disease-associated biochemical changes in the CSF. 
      We achieved very high reproducibility in double-blind experiments for testing the 
      feasibility of our system on human samples. We achieved an overall accuracy of 
      92% (100% for normal individuals and 88.9% for AD individuals) based on the 
      clinical diagnosis. Further, we observed an excellent correlation coefficient 
      between our test score and the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. Our findings 
      offer a substantial indication of the feasibility of detecting AD biomarkers 
      using the innovative combination of SERS and machine learning. We are hoping that 
      this will serve as an incentive for future research in the field.

TI  - Deep learning applications in vascular dementia using neuroimaging.
PG  - 101-106
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000920 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second common cause of dementia 
      after Alzheimer's disease, and deep learning has emerged as a critical tool in 
      dementia research. The aim of this article is to highlight the current deep 
      learning applications in VaD-related imaging biomarkers and diagnosis. RECENT 
      FINDINGS: The main deep learning technology applied in VaD using neuroimaging 
      data is convolutional neural networks (CNN). CNN models have been widely used for 
      lesion detection and segmentation, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH), 
      cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), perivascular spaces (PVS), lacunes, cortical 
      superficial siderosis, and brain atrophy. Applications in VaD subtypes 
      classification also showed excellent results. CNN-based deep learning models have 
      potential for further diagnosis and prognosis of VaD. SUMMARY: Deep learning 
      neural networks with neuroimaging data in VaD research represent significant 
      promise for advancing early diagnosis and treatment strategies. Ongoing research 
      and collaboration between clinicians, data scientists, and neuroimaging experts 
      are essential to address challenges and unlock the full potential of deep 
      learning in VaD diagnosis and management.

AB  - Neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders has gained 
      increasing attention in recent years. Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities 
      such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning 
      techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification 
      of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as 
      schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published 
      during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a 
      multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of 
      more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum 
      disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed 
      information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted 
      features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge, 
      this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject 
      prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on 
      major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common 
      biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such 
      as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, 
      disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on 
      this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of 
      neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However, 
      the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size, 
      which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the 
      ones discussed in this paper. Emerging big data technologies and advanced 
      data-intensive machine learning methodologies such as deep learning have 
      coincided with an increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single 
      subject prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time. In this report, we 
      survey the past and offer some opinions regarding the road ahead.

AB  - Next-generation tools for multiplexed imaging have driven a new wave of 
      innovation in understanding how single-cell function and tissue structure are 
      interrelated. In previous work, we developed multiplexed ion beam imaging by time 
      of flight, a highly multiplexed platform that uses secondary ion mass 
      spectrometry to image dozens of antibodies tagged with metal reporters. As 
      instrument throughput has increased, the breadth and depth of imaging data have 
      increased as well. To extract meaningful information from these data, we have 
      developed tools for cell identification, cell classification, and spatial 
      analysis. In this review, we discuss these tools and provide examples of their 
      application in various contexts, including ductal carcinoma in situ, 
      tuberculosis, and Alzheimer's disease. We hope the synergy between multiplexed 
      imaging and automated image analysis will drive a new era in anatomic pathology 
      and personalized medicine wherein quantitative spatial signatures are used 
      routinely for more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic selection.

TI  - MRI Segmentation and Classification of Human Brain Using Deep Learning for 
      Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease: A Survey.
LID - 10.3390/s20113243 [doi]
LID - 3243
AB  - Many neurological diseases and delineating pathological regions have been 
      analyzed, and the anatomical structure of the brain researched with the aid of 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is important to identify patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) early so that preventative measures can be taken. A 
      detailed analysis of the tissue structures from segmented MRI leads to a more 
      accurate classification of specific brain disorders. Several segmentation methods 
      to diagnose AD have been proposed with varying complexity. Segmentation of the 
      brain structure and classification of AD using deep learning approaches has 
      gained attention as it can provide effective results over a large set of data. 
      Hence, deep learning methods are now preferred over state-of-the-art machine 
      learning methods. We aim to provide an outline of current deep learning-based 
      segmentation approaches for the quantitative analysis of brain MRI for the 
      diagnosis of AD. Here, we report how convolutional neural network architectures 
      are used to analyze the anatomical brain structure and diagnose AD, discuss how 
      brain MRI segmentation improves AD classification, describe the state-of-the-art 
      approaches, and summarize their results using publicly available datasets. 
      Finally, we provide insight into current issues and discuss possible future 
      research directions in building a computer-aided diagnostic system for AD.

TI  - The Boston Process Approach and Digital Neuropsychological Assessment: Past 
      Research and Future Directions.

AB  - Neuropsychological assessment using the Boston Process Approach (BPA) suggests 
      that an analysis of the strategy or the process by which tasks and 
      neuropsychological tests are completed, and the errors made during test 
      completion convey much information regarding underlying brain and cognition and 
      are as important as overall summary scores. Research over the last several 
      decades employing an analysis of process and errors has been able to dissociate 
      between dementia patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia 
      associated with MRI-determined white matter alterations, and Parkinson's disease; 
      and between mild cognitive impairment subtypes. Nonetheless, BPA methods can be 
      labor intensive to deploy. However, the recent availability of digital platforms 
      for neuropsychological test administration and scoring now enables reliable, 
      rapid, and objective data collection. Further, digital technology can quantify 
      highly nuanced data previously unobtainable to define neurocognitive constructs 
      with high accuracy. In this paper, a brief review of the BPA is provided. Studies 
      that demonstrate how digital technology translates BPA into specific 
      neurocognitive constructs using the Clock Drawing Test, Backward Digit Span Test, 
      and a Digital Pointing Span Test are described. Implications for using data 
      driven artificial intelligence-supported analytic approaches enabling the 
      creation of more sensitive and specific detection/diagnostic algorithms for 
      putative neurodegenerative illness are also discussed.

TI  - Use of Artificial Intelligence in Imaging Dementia.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly 
      population (aged 65 years and over), followed by vascular dementia, Lewy body 
      dementia, and rare types of neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal 
      dementia. There is an unmet need to improve diagnosis and prognosis for patients 
      with dementia, as cycles of misdiagnosis and diagnostic delays are challenging 
      scenarios in neurodegenerative diseases. Neuroimaging is routinely used in 
      clinical practice to support the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Clinical neuroimaging is amenable to errors owing to varying human judgement as 
      the imaging data are complex and multidimensional. Artificial intelligence 
      algorithms (machine learning and deep learning) enable automation of neuroimaging 
      interpretation and may reduce potential bias and ameliorate clinical 
      decision-making. Graph convolutional network-based frameworks implicitly provide 
      multimodal sparse interpretability to support the detection of Alzheimer's 
      disease and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment. In patients with 
      amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, radiologists had significantly better 
      detection performances with both ARIA-E (sensitivity higher in the assisted/deep 
      learning method [87%] compared to unassisted [71%]) and for ARIA-H signs 
      (sensitivity was higher in assisted [79%] compared to unassisted [69%]). A 
      convolutional neural network method was developed, and external validation 
      predicted final clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy 
      bodies, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease, or cognitively 
      normal with FDG-PET. The translation of artificial intelligence to clinical 
      practice is plagued with technical, disease-related, and institutional 
      challenges. The implementation of artificial intelligence methods in clinical 
      practice has the potential to transform the diagnostic and treatment landscape 
      and improve patient health and outcomes.

TI  - The status of MRI databases across the world focused on psychiatric and 
      neurological disorders.
PG  - 563-579
LID - 10.1111/pcn.13717 [doi]
AB  - Neuroimaging databases for neuro-psychiatric disorders enable researchers to 
      implement data-driven research approaches by providing access to rich data that 
      can be used to study disease, build and validate machine learning models, and 
      even redefine disease spectra. The importance of sharing large, multi-center, 
      multi-disorder databases has gradually been recognized in order to truly 
      translate brain imaging knowledge into real-world clinical practice. Here, we 
      review MRI databases that share data globally to serve multiple psychiatric or 
      neurological disorders. We found 42 datasets consisting of 23,293 samples from 
      patients with psychiatry and neurological disorders and healthy controls; 1245 
      samples from mood disorders (major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder), 
      2015 samples from developmental disorders (autism spectrum disorder, 
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder), 675 samples from schizophrenia, 1194 
      samples from Parkinson's disease, 5865 samples from dementia (including 
      Alzheimer's disease), We recognize that large, multi-center databases should 
      include governance processes that allow data to be shared across national 
      boundaries. Addressing technical and regulatory issues of existing databases can 
      lead to better design and implementation and improve data access for the research 
      community. The current trend toward the development of shareable MRI databases 
      will contribute to a better understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis and 
      assessment, and development of early interventions for neuropsychiatric 
      disorders.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This comprehensive review delves into the intricate interplay 
      between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and osteoporosis, two prevalent conditions with 
      significant implications for individuals' quality of life. The purpose is to 
      explore their bidirectional association, underpinned by common pathological 
      processes such as aging, genetic factors, inflammation, and estrogen deficiency. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Recent advances have shown promise in treating both Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) and osteoporosis by targeting disease-specific proteins and bone 
      metabolism regulators. Monoclonal antibodies against beta-amyloid and tau for AD, 
      as well as RANKL and sclerostin for osteoporosis, have displayed therapeutic 
      potential. Additionally, ongoing research has identified neuroinflammatory genes 
      shared between AD and osteoporosis, offering insight into the interconnected 
      inflammatory mechanisms. This knowledge opens avenues for innovative dual-purpose 
      therapies that could address both conditions, potentially revolutionizing 
      treatment approaches for AD and osteoporosis simultaneously. This review 
      underscores the potential for groundbreaking advancements in early diagnosis and 
      treatment by unraveling the intricate connection between AD and bone health. It 
      advocates for a holistic, patient-centered approach to medical care that 
      considers both cognitive and bone health, ultimately aiming to enhance the 
      overall well-being of individuals affected by these conditions. This review 
      article is part of a series of multiple manuscripts designed to determine the 
      utility of using artificial intelligence for writing scientific reviews.

AB  - Cognitive decline is a gradual neurodegenerative process that is affected by 
      genetic and environmental factors. The doctor-patient relationship in the 
      healthcare for cognitive decline is in a "shallow" medical world. With the 
      development of data science, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 
      digital twin, the introduction of the concept of the metaverse in medicine has 
      brought alternative and complementary strategies in the intervention of cognitive 
      decline. This article technically analyzes the application scenarios and 
      paradigms of the metaverse in medicine in the field of mental health, such as 
      hospital management, diagnosis, prediction, prevention, rehabilitation, 
      progression delay, assisting life, companionship, and supervision. The metaverse 
      in medicine has made primary progress in education, immersive consultation, 
      dental disease, and Parkinson's disease, bringing revolutionary prospects for 
      non-pharmacological complementary treatment of cognitive decline and other mental 
      problems. In particular, with the demand for non-face-to-face communication 
      generated by the global COVID-19 epidemic, the needs for uncontactable healthcare 
      service for the elderly have increased. The paradigm of self-monitoring, 
      self-healing, and healthcare experienced by the elderly through the metaverse in 
      medicine, especially from meta-platform, meta-community, and meta-hospital, will 
      be generated, which will reconstruct the service modes for the elderly people. 
      The future map of the metaverse in medicine is huge, which depends on the 
      co-construction of community partners.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a brain disorder that causes the brain to shrink and 
      eventually causes brain cells to die. This neurological condition progressively 
      hampers cognitive and memory functions, along with the ability to carry out 
      fundamental tasks over time. From the symptoms it is very difficult to detect 
      during its early stage. It has become necessary to develop a computer assisted 
      diagnostic models for the early AD detection. This survey work, discussed about a 
      review of 110 published AD detection methods and techniques from the year 2011 to 
      till-date. This study lies in its comprehensive exploration of AD detection 
      methods using a range of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and neuroimaging 
      modalities. By collecting and analysing 50 papers related to AD diagnosis 
      datasets, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of the diversity of 
      input types, subjects, and classes used in AD research. Summarizing 60 papers on 
      methodologies gives researchers a succinct overview of various approaches that 
      contribute to enhancing detection accuracy. From the review, data are acquired 
      and pre-processed form multiple modalities of neuroimaging. This paper mainly 
      focused on review of different datasets used, various feature extraction methods, 
      parameters used in neuro images. To diagnosis the Alzheimer's disease, the 
      existing methods utilized three most common artificial intelligence techniques 
      such as machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning. We conclude this 
      survey work by providing future perspectives for AD diagnosis at early stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has influenced all aspects of human life 
      and neurology is no exception to this growing trend. The aim of this paper is to 
      guide medical practitioners on the relevant aspects of artificial intelligence, 
      i.e., machine learning, and deep learning, to review the development of 
      technological advancement equipped with AI, and to elucidate how machine learning 
      can revolutionize the management of neurological diseases. This review focuses on 
      unsupervised aspects of machine learning, and how these aspects could be applied 
      to precision neurology to improve patient outcomes. We have mentioned various 
      forms of available AI, prior research, outcomes, benefits and limitations of AI, 
      effective accessibility and future of AI, keeping the current burden of 
      neurological disorders in mind. DISCUSSION: The smart device system to monitor 
      tremors and to recognize its phenotypes for better outcomes of deep brain 
      stimulation, applications evaluating fine motor functions, AI integrated 
      electroencephalogram learning to diagnose epilepsy and psychological 
      non-epileptic seizure, predict outcome of seizure surgeries, recognize patterns 
      of autonomic instability to prevent sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), 
      identify the pattern of complex algorithm in neuroimaging classifying cognitive 
      impairment, differentiating and classifying concussion phenotypes, smartwatches 
      monitoring atrial fibrillation to prevent strokes, and prediction of prognosis in 
      dementia are unique examples of experimental utilizations of AI in the field of 
      neurology. Though there are obvious limitations of AI, the general consensus 
      among several nationwide studies is that this new technology has the ability to 
      improve the prognosis of neurological disorders and as a result should become a 
      staple in the medical community. CONCLUSION: AI not only helps to analyze medical 
      data in disease prevention, diagnosis, patient monitoring, and development of new 
      protocols, but can also assist clinicians in dealing with voluminous data in a 
      more accurate and efficient manner.

AB  - In the recent 5 years (2014-2018), there has been growing interest in the use of 
      machine learning (ML) techniques to explore image diagnosis and prognosis of 
      therapeutic lesion changes within the area of neuroradiology. However, to date, 
      the majority of research trend and current status have not been clearly 
      illuminated in the neuroradiology field. More than 1000 papers have been 
      published during the past 5 years on subject classification and prediction 
      focused on multiple brain disorders. We provide a survey of 209 papers in this 
      field with a focus on top ten active areas of research; i.e., Alzheimer's 
      disease/mild cognitive impairment, brain tumor; schizophrenia, depressive 
      disorders, Parkinson's disease, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism 
      spectrum disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain 
      injury. Detailed information of these studies, such as ML methods, sample size, 
      type of inputted features and reported accuracy, are summarized. This paper 
      reviews the evidences, current limitations and status of studies using ML to 
      assess brain disorders in neuroimaging data. The main bottleneck of this research 
      field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by 
      modern data sharing models, such as ADNI.

      the ML Perspective.
PG  - 2924-2935
LID - 10.1109/TBME.2019.2898871 [doi]
AB  - This paper reviews the state-of-the-art neuromarkers development for the 
      prognosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The 
      first part of this paper is devoted to reviewing the recently emerged machine 
      learning (ML) algorithms based on electroencephalography (EEG) and 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG) modalities. In particular, the methods are 
      categorized by different types of neuromarkers. The second part of the review is 
      dedicated to a series of investigations that further highlight the differences 
      between these two modalities. First, several source reconstruction methods are 
      reviewed and their source-level performances explored, followed by an objective 
      comparison between EEG and MEG from multiple perspectives. Finally, a number of 
      the most recent reports on classification of MCI/AD during resting state using 
      EEG/MEG are documented to show the up-to-date performance for this 
      well-recognized data collecting scenario. It is noticed that the MEG modality may 
      be particularly effective in distinguishing between subjects with MCI and healthy 
      controls, a high classification accuracy of more than 98% was reported recently; 
      whereas the EEG seems to be performing well in classifying AD and healthy 
      subjects, which also reached around 98% of the accuracy. A number of influential 
      factors have also been raised and suggested for careful considerations while 
      evaluating the ML-based diagnosis systems in the real-world scenarios.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD) are progressive neurological disorders that significantly impair the 
      cognitive functions, memory, and daily activities. They affect millions of 
      individuals worldwide, posing a significant challenge for its diagnosis and 
      management, leading to detrimental impacts on patients' quality of lives and 
      increased burden on caregivers. Hence, early detection of MCI and AD is crucial 
      for timely intervention and effective disease management. METHODS: This study 
      presents a comprehensive systematic review focusing on the applications of deep 
      learning in detecting MCI and AD using electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. 
      Through a rigorous literature screening process based on the Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, the research 
      has investigated 74 different papers in detail to analyze the different 
      approaches used to detect MCI and AD neurological disorders. RESULTS: The 
      findings of this study stand out as the first to deal with the classification of 
      dual MCI and AD (MCI+AD) using EEG signals. This unique approach has enabled us 
      to highlight the state-of-the-art high-performing models, specifically focusing 
      on deep learning while examining their strengths and limitations in detecting the 
      MCI, AD, and the MCI+AD comorbidity situations. CONCLUSION: The present study has 
      not only identified the current limitations in deep learning area for MCI and AD 
      detection but also proposes specific future directions to address these 
      neurological disorders by implement best practice deep learning approaches. Our 
      main goal is to offer insights as references for future research encouraging the 
      development of deep learning techniques in early detection and diagnosis of MCI 
      and AD neurological disorders. By recommending the most effective deep learning 
      tools, we have also provided a benchmark for future research, with clear 
      implications for the practical use of these techniques in healthcare.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a scoping review that examines potentials of 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) in early diagnosis of Cognitive Decline (CD), which 
      is regarded as a key issue in elderly health. The review encompasses 
      peer-reviewed publications from 2020 to 2025, including scientific journals and 
      conference proceedings. Over 70% of the studies rely on using magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) as the input to the AI models, with a high diagnostic accuracy of 
      98%. Integration of the relevant clinical data and electroencephalograms (EEG) 
      with deep learning methods enhances diagnostic accuracy in the clinical settings. 
      Recent studies have also explored the use of natural language processing models 
      for detecting CD at its early stages, with an accuracy of 75%, exhibiting a high 
      potential to be used in the appropriate pre-clinical environments.

TI  - Factors associated with brain ageing - a systematic review.
PG  - 312
LID - 10.1186/s12883-021-02331-4 [doi]
LID - 312
AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain age is a biomarker that predicts chronological age using 
      neuroimaging features. Deviations of this predicted age from chronological age is 
      considered a sign of age-related brain changes, or commonly referred to as brain 
      ageing. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and synthesize the 
      evidence for an association between lifestyle, health factors and diseases in 
      adult populations, with brain ageing. METHODS: This systematic review was 
      undertaken in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of 
      Embase and Medline was conducted to identify relevant articles using search terms 
      relating to the prediction of age from neuroimaging data or brain ageing. The 
      tables of two recent review papers on brain ageing were also examined to identify 
      additional articles. Studies were limited to adult humans (aged 18 years and 
      above), from clinical or general populations. Exposures and study design of all 
      types were also considered eligible. RESULTS: A systematic search identified 52 
      studies, which examined brain ageing in clinical and community dwelling adults 
      (mean age between 21 to 78 years, ~ 37% were female). Most research came from 
      studies of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease, or 
      healthy populations that were assessed cognitively. From these studies, 
      psychiatric and neurologic diseases were most commonly associated with 
      accelerated brain ageing, though not all studies drew the same conclusions. 
      Evidence for all other exposures is nascent, and relatively inconsistent. 
      Heterogenous methodologies, or methods of outcome ascertainment, were partly 
      accountable. CONCLUSION: This systematic review summarised the current evidence 
      for an association between genetic, lifestyle, health, or diseases and brain 
      ageing. Overall there is good evidence to suggest schizophrenia and Alzheimer's 
      disease are associated with accelerated brain ageing. Evidence for all other 
      exposures was mixed or limited. This was mostly due to a lack of independent 
      replication, and inconsistency across studies that were primarily cross sectional 
      in nature. Future research efforts should focus on replicating current findings, 
      using prospective datasets. TRIAL REGISTRATION: A copy of the review protocol can 
      be accessed through PROSPERO, registration number CRD42020142817 .

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: With populations aging, the number of people with 
      dementia worldwide is expected to triple to 152 million by 2050. Seventy percent 
      of cases are due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and there is a 10-20 year 
      'pre-clinical' period before significant cognitive decline occurs. We urgently 
      need, cost effective, objective biomarkers to detect AD, and other dementias, at 
      an early stage. Risk factor modification could prevent 40% of cases and drug 
      trials would have greater chances of success if participants are recruited at an 
      earlier stage. Currently, detection of dementia is largely by pen and paper 
      cognitive tests but these are time consuming and insensitive to the pre-clinical 
      phase. Specialist brain scans and body fluid biomarkers can detect the earliest 
      stages of dementia but are too invasive or expensive for widespread use. With the 
      advancement of technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promising results 
      in assisting with detection of early-stage dementia. This scoping review aims to 
      summarise the current capabilities of AI-aided digital biomarkers to aid in early 
      detection of dementia, and also discusses potential future research directions. 
      METHODS & MATERIALS: In this scoping review, we used PubMed and IEEE Xplore to 
      identify relevant papers. The resulting records were further filtered to retrieve 
      articles published within five years and written in English. Duplicates were 
      removed, titles and abstracts were screened and full texts were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: After an initial yield of 1,463 records, 1,444 records were screened 
      after removal of duplication. A further 771 records were excluded after screening 
      titles and abstracts, and 496 were excluded after full text review. The final 
      yield was 177 studies. Records were grouped into different artificial 
      intelligence based tests: (a) computerized cognitive tests (b) movement tests (c) 
      speech, conversion, and language tests and (d) computer-assisted interpretation 
      of brain scans. CONCLUSIONS: In general, AI techniques enhance the performance of 
      dementia screening tests because more features can be retrieved from a single 
      test, there are less errors due to subjective judgements and AI shifts the 
      automation of dementia screening to a higher level. Compared with traditional 
      cognitive tests, AI-based computerized cognitive tests improve the discrimination 
      sensitivity by around 4% and specificity by around 3%. In terms of speech, 
      conversation and language tests, combining both acoustic features and linguistic 
      features achieve the best result with accuracy around 94%. Deep learning 
      techniques applied in brain scan analysis achieves around 92% accuracy. Movement 
      tests and setting smart environments to capture daily life behaviours are two 
      potential future directions that may help discriminate dementia from normal 
      aging. AI-based smart environments and multi-modal tests are promising future 
      directions to improve detection of dementia in the earliest stages.

TI  - Review of Technological Challenges in Personalised Medicine and Early Diagnosis 
      of Neurodegenerative Disorders.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043321 [doi]
LID - 3321
AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are characterised by progressive neuron loss in 
      specific brain areas. The most common are Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's 
      disease; in both cases, diagnosis is based on clinical tests with limited 
      capability to discriminate between similar neurodegenerative disorders and detect 
      the early stages of the disease. It is common that by the time a patient is 
      diagnosed with the disease, the level of neurodegeneration is already severe. 
      Thus, it is critical to find new diagnostic methods that allow earlier and more 
      accurate disease detection. This study reviews the methods available for the 
      clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases and potentially interesting new 
      technologies. Neuroimaging techniques are the most widely used in clinical 
      practice, and new techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
      positron emission tomography (PET) have significantly improved the diagnosis 
      quality. Identifying biomarkers in peripheral samples such as blood or 
      cerebrospinal fluid is a major focus of the current research on neurodegenerative 
      diseases. The discovery of good markers could allow preventive screening to 
      identify early or asymptomatic stages of the neurodegenerative process. These 
      methods, in combination with artificial intelligence, could contribute to the 
      generation of predictive models that will help clinicians in the early diagnosis, 
      stratification, and prognostic assessment of patients, leading to improvements in 
      patient treatment and quality of life.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      progressive cognitive decline, is generally prevalent in elderly people with 
      significant disability and mortality. There is no effective treatment for AD 
      currently, but the early diagnosis might be beneficial for delaying the disease 
      progression. Apart from invasive laboratory tests and expensive neuroimaging 
      examination, the electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potentials (ERPs) 
      have emerged as promising approaches for the early detection of AD as well as 
      mild cognitive impairment (MCI), due to its affordability, noninvasively, and 
      superior temporal resolution. In addition, the recent advent of deep learning 
      architectures further improves the accuracy of AD and MCI diagnosis. This article 
      reviewed the application of EEG signal for the early diagnosis of AD and MCI, 
      especially focusing on ERPs and deep learning. Furthermore, recommendation for 
      further research to recruit the combination of ERP components and deep leaning 
      models in diagnosing AD and MCI was proposed and highlighted.

TI  - Detection of Alzheimer Disease in Neuroimages Using Vision Transformers: 
      Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e62647
LID - 10.2196/62647 [doi]
LID - e62647
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) is a progressive condition characterized by 
      cognitive decline and memory loss. Vision transformers (ViTs) are emerging as 
      promising deep learning models in medical imaging, with potential applications in 
      the detection and diagnosis of AD. OBJECTIVE: This review systematically examines 
      recent studies on the application of ViTs in detecting AD, evaluating the 
      diagnostic accuracy and impact of network architecture on model performance. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across major medical databases, 
      including China National Knowledge Infrastructure, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central 
      Register of Controlled Trials), ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, and 
      Scopus, covering publications from January 1, 2020, to March 1, 2024. A manual 
      search was also performed to include relevant gray literature. The included 
      papers used ViT models for AD detection versus healthy controls based on 
      neuroimaging data, and the included studies used magnetic resonance imaging and 
      positron emission tomography. Pooled diagnostic accuracy estimates, including 
      sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios, were 
      derived using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses comparing the diagnostic 
      performance of different ViT network architectures were performed. RESULTS: The 
      meta-analysis, encompassing 11 studies with 95% CIs and P values, demonstrated 
      pooled diagnostic accuracy: sensitivity 0.925 (95% CI 0.892-0.959; P<.01), 
      specificity 0.957 (95% CI 0.932-0.981; P<.01), positive likelihood ratio 21.84 
      (95% CI 12.26-38.91; P<.01), and negative likelihood ratio 0.08 (95% CI 
      0.05-0.14; P<.01). The area under the curve was notably high at 0.924. The 
      findings highlight the potential of ViTs as effective tools for early and 
      accurate AD diagnosis, offering insights for future neuroimaging-based diagnostic 
      approaches. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides valuable evidence for 
      the utility of ViT models in distinguishing patients with AD from healthy 
      controls, thereby contributing to advancements in neuroimaging-based diagnostic 
      methodologies. TRIAL REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42024584347;

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder that leads to progressive, 
      irreversible cognitive decline. To obtain an accurate and timely diagnosis and 
      detect AD at an early stage, numerous approaches based on convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs) using neuroimaging data have been proposed. Because 3D CNNs can 
      extract more spatial discrimination information than 2D CNNs, they have emerged 
      as a promising research direction in the diagnosis of AD. The aim of this article 
      is to present the current state of the art in the diagnosis of AD using 3D 
      CNN models and neuroimaging modalities, focusing on the 3D CNN architectures and 
      classification methods used, and to highlight potential future research topics. 
      To give the reader a better overview of the content mentioned in this review, we 
      briefly introduce the commonly used imaging datasets and the fundamentals of CNN 
      architectures. Then we carefully analyzed the existing studies on AD diagnosis, 
      which are divided into two levels according to their inputs: 3D subject-level 
      CNNs and 3D patch-level CNNs, highlighting their contributions and significance 
      in the field. In addition, this review discusses the key findings and challenges 
      from the studies and highlights the lessons learned as a roadmap for future 
      research. Finally, we summarize the paper by presenting some major findings, 
      identifying open research challenges, and pointing out future research 
      directions.

AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often considered an early stage of dementia, 
      with estimated rates of progression to dementia up to 80-90% after approximately 
      6 years from the initial diagnosis. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment in dementia 
      is typically based on clinical evaluation, neuropsychological assessments, 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and neuroimaging. The main goal of 
      diagnosing MCI is to determine its cause, particularly whether it is due to 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, only a limited percentage of the population 
      has access to etiological confirmation, which has led to the emergence of 
      peripheral fluid biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for dementias, including MCI due 
      to AD. Recent advances in biofluid assays have enabled the use of sophisticated 
      statistical models and multimodal machine learning (ML) algorithms for the 
      diagnosis of MCI based on fluid biomarkers from CSF, peripheral blood, and 
      saliva, among others. This approach has shown promise for identifying specific 
      causes of MCI, including AD. After a PRISMA analysis, 29 articles revealed a 
      trend towards using multimodal algorithms that incorporate additional biomarkers 
      such as neuroimaging, neuropsychological tests, and genetic information. 
      Particularly, neuroimaging is commonly used in conjunction with fluid biomarkers 
      for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Our systematic review suggests 
      that cost-effective longitudinal multimodal monitoring data, representative of 
      diverse cultural populations and utilizing white-box ML algorithms, could be a 
      valuable contribution to the development of diagnostic models for AD due to MCI. 
      Clinical assessment and biomarkers, together with ML techniques, could prove 
      pivotal in improving diagnostic tools for MCI due to AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders 
      worldwide, characterized by significant memory and cognitive decline in its later 
      stages, severely impacting daily lives. Consequently, early diagnosis and 
      accurate assessment are crucial for delaying disease progression. In recent 
      years, multimodal imaging has gained widespread adoption in AD diagnosis and 
      research, particularly the combined use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The complementarity of these modalities in 
      structural and metabolic information offers a unique advantage for comprehensive 
      disease understanding and precise diagnosis. With the rapid advancement of deep 
      learning techniques, efficient fusion of MRI and PET multimodal data has emerged 
      as a prominent research focus. This review systematically surveys the latest 
      advancements in deep learning-based multimodal fusion of MRI and PET images for 
      AD research, with a particular focus on studies published in the past five years 
      (2021-2025). It first introduces the main sources of AD-related data, along with 
      data preprocessing and feature extraction methods. Then, it summarizes 
      performance metrics and multimodal fusion techniques. Next, it explores the 
      application of various deep learning models and their variants in multimodal 
      fusion tasks. Finally, it analyzes the key challenges currently faced in the 
      field, including data scarcity and imbalance, inter-institutional data 
      heterogeneity, etc., and discusses potential solutions and future research 
      directions. This review aims to provide systematic guidance for researchers in 
      the field of MRI and PET multimodal fusion, with the ultimate goal of advancing 
      the development of early AD diagnosis and intervention strategies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Retinal images contain rich biomarker information for neurodegenerative 
      disease. Recently, deep learning models have been used for automated 
      neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and risk prediction using retinal images with 
      good results. METHODS: In this review, we systematically report studies with 
      datasets of retinal images from patients with neurodegenerative diseases, 
      including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and others. We also review and characterize the 
      models in the current literature which have been used for classification, 
      regression, or segmentation problems using retinal images in patients with 
      neurodegenerative diseases. RESULTS: Our review found several existing datasets 
      and models with various imaging modalities primarily in patients with Alzheimer's 
      disease, with most datasets on the order of tens to a few hundred images. We 
      found limited data available for the other neurodegenerative diseases. Although 
      cross-sectional imaging data for Alzheimer's disease is becoming more abundant, 
      datasets with longitudinal imaging of any disease are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      use of bilateral and multimodal imaging together with metadata seems to improve 
      model performance, thus multimodal bilateral image datasets with patient metadata 
      are needed. We identified several deep learning tools that have been useful in 
      this context including feature extraction algorithms specifically for retinal 
      images, retinal image preprocessing techniques, transfer learning, feature 
      fusion, and attention mapping. Importantly, we also consider the limitations 
      common to these models in real-world clinical applications. TRANSLATIONAL 
      RELEVANCE: This systematic review evaluates the deep learning models and retinal 
      features relevant in the evaluation of retinal images of patients with 
      neurodegenerative disease.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases have shown an increasing incidence in the older 
      population in recent years. A significant amount of research has been conducted 
      to characterize these diseases. Computational methods, and particularly machine 
      learning techniques, are now very useful tools in helping and improving the 
      diagnosis as well as the disease monitoring process. In this paper, we provide an 
      in-depth review on existing computational approaches used in the whole 
      neurodegenerative spectrum, namely for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's 
      Diseases, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Multiple System Atrophy. We propose 
      a taxonomy of the specific clinical features, and of the existing computational 
      methods. We provide a detailed analysis of the various modalities and decision 
      systems employed for each disease. We identify and present the sleep disorders 
      which are present in various diseases and which represent an important asset for 
      onset detection. We overview the existing data set resources and evaluation 
      metrics. Finally, we identify current remaining open challenges and discuss 
      future perspectives.

AB  - There is an increasing role for biological markers (biomarkers) in the 
      understanding and diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. The application of 
      imaging biomarkers specifically for the in vivo investigation of 
      neurodegenerative disorders has increased substantially over the past decades and 
      continues to provide further benefits both to the diagnosis and understanding of 
      these diseases. This review forms part of a series of articles which stem from 
      the University College London/University of Gothenburg course "Biomarkers in 
      neurodegenerative diseases". In this review, we focus on neuroimaging, 
      specifically positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI), giving an overview of the current established practices clinically and in 
      research as well as new techniques being developed. We will also discuss the use 
      of machine learning (ML) techniques within these fields to provide additional 
      insights to early diagnosis and multimodal analysis.

AB  - Discoveries in the field of medical sciences are blooming rapidly at the cost of 
      voluminous efforts. Presently, multidisciplinary research activities have been 
      especially contributing to catering cutting-edge solutions to critical problems 
      in the domain of medical sciences. The modern age computing resources have proved 
      to be a boon in this context. Effortless solutions have become a reality, and 
      thus, the real beneficiary patients are able to enjoy improved lives. One of the 
      most emerging problems in this context is Alzheimer's disease, an incurable 
      neurological disorder. For this, early diagnosis is made possible with benchmark 
      computing tools and schemes. These benchmark schemes are the results of novel 
      research contributions being made intermittently in the timeline. In this review, 
      an attempt is made to explore all such contributions in the past few decades. A 
      systematic review is made by categorizing these contributions into three folds, 
      namely, First, Second, and Third Generations. However, priority is given to the 
      latest ones as a handful of literature reviews are already available for the 
      classical ones. Key contributions are discussed vividly. The objectives set for 
      this review are to bring forth the latest discoveries in computing methodologies, 
      especially those dedicated to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. A detailed 
      timeline of the contributions is also made available. Performance plots for 
      certain key contributions are also presented for better graphical understanding.

TI  - Advancing Remote Monitoring for Patients With Alzheimer Disease and Related 
      Dementias: Systematic Review.
PG  - e69175
LID - 10.2196/69175 [doi]
LID - e69175
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using remote monitoring technology in the context of Alzheimer 
      disease (AD) care presents exciting new opportunities to lessen caregiver stress 
      and improve patient care quality. The application of wearables, environmental 
      sensors, and smart home systems designed specifically for patients with AD 
      represents a promising interdisciplinary approach that integrates advanced 
      technology with health care to enhance patient safety, monitor health parameters 
      in real time, and provide comprehensive support to caregivers. OBJECTIVE: The 
      objectives of this study included evaluating the effectiveness of various remote 
      sensing technologies in enhancing patient outcomes and identifying strategies to 
      alleviate the burden on health care professionals and caregivers. Critical 
      elements such as regulatory compliance, user-centered design, privacy and 
      security considerations, and the overall efficacy of relevant technologies were 
      comprehensively examined. Ultimately, this study aimed to propose a comprehensive 
      remote monitoring framework tailored to the needs of patients with AD and related 
      dementias. METHODS: Guided by the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework, we conducted a systematic review 
      on remote monitoring for patients with AD and related dementias. Our search 
      spanned 4 major electronic databases-Google Scholar, PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and 
      DBLP on February 20, 2024, with an updated search on May 18, 2024. RESULTS: A 
      total of 31 publications met the inclusion criteria, highlighting 4 key research 
      areas: existing remote monitoring technologies, balancing practicality and 
      empathy, security and privacy in monitoring, and technology design for AD care. 
      The studies revealed a strong focus on various remote monitoring methods for 
      capturing behavioral, physiological, and environmental data yet showed a gap in 
      evaluating these methods for patient and caregiver needs, privacy, and usability. 
      The findings also indicated that many studies lacked robust reference standards 
      and did not consistently apply critical appraisal criteria, underlining the need 
      for comprehensive frameworks that better integrate these essential 
      considerations. CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive literature review of remote 
      monitoring technologies for patients with AD provides an understanding of remote 
      monitoring technologies, trends, and gaps in the current research and the 
      significance of novel strategies for remote monitoring to enhance patient 
      outcomes and reduce the burden among health professionals and caregivers. The 
      proposed remote monitoring framework aims to inspire the development of new 
      interdisciplinary research models that advance care for patients with AD.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), characterized by progressive neuronal 
      degeneration and manifesting in diverse forms such as memory loss and movement 
      disorders, pose significant challenges due to their complex molecular mechanisms 
      and heterogeneous patient presentations. Diagnosis often relies heavily on 
      clinical assessments and neuroimaging, with definitive confirmation frequently 
      requiring post-mortem autopsy. However, the emergence of Artificial Intelligence 
      (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offers a transformative potential. These 
      technologies can enable the development of non-invasive tools for early 
      diagnosis, biomarker identification, personalized treatment strategies, patient 
      subtyping and stratification, and disease risk prediction. This review aims to 
      provide a starting point for researchers, both with and without clinical 
      backgrounds, who are interested in applying ML to NDs. We will discuss available 
      data resources for key diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, explore how ML 
      can revolutionize neurodegenerative care, and emphasize the importance of 
      integrating multiple high-dimensional data sources to gain deeper insights and 
      inform effective therapeutic strategies.

      characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles with tau protein and 
      extracellular β-amyloid plaques. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for 
      effective treatment and management. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to 
      investigate new technologies that improve diagnostic accuracy while looking at 
      the current diagnostic criteria for AD, such as clinical evaluations, cognitive 
      testing, and biomarker-based techniques. METHODS: A thorough review of the 
      literature was done in order to assess both conventional and contemporary 
      diagnostic methods. Multimodal strategies integrating clinical, imaging, and 
      biochemical evaluations were emphasised. The promise of current developments in 
      biomarker discovery was also examined, including mass spectrometry and artificial 
      intelligence. RESULTS: Current diagnostic approaches include cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) biomarkers, imaging tools (MRI, PET), cognitive tests, and new blood-based 
      markers. Integrating these technologies into multimodal diagnostic procedures 
      enhances diagnostic accuracy and distinguishes dementia from other conditions. 
      New technologies that hold promise for improving biomarker identification and 
      diagnostic reliability include mass spectrometry and artificial intelligence. 
      CONCLUSION: Advancements in AD diagnostics underscore the need for accessible, 
      minimally invasive, and cost-effective techniques to facilitate early detection 
      and intervention. The integration of novel technologies with traditional methods 
      may significantly enhance the accuracy and feasibility of AD diagnosis.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article argues that the time is approaching for 
      data-driven disease modelling to take centre stage in the study and management of 
      neurodegenerative disease. The snowstorm of data now available to the clinician 
      defies qualitative evaluation; the heterogeneity of data types complicates 
      integration through traditional statistical methods; and the large datasets 
      becoming available remain far from the big-data sizes necessary for fully 
      data-driven machine-learning approaches. The recent emergence of data-driven 
      disease progression models provides a balance between imposed knowledge of 
      disease features and patterns learned from data. The resulting models are both 
      predictive of disease progression in individual patients and informative in terms 
      of revealing underlying biological patterns. RECENT FINDINGS: Largely inspired by 
      observational models, data-driven disease progression models have emerged in the 
      last few years as a feasible means for understanding the development of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. These models have revealed insights into 
      frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's 
      disease and other conditions. For example, event-based models have revealed finer 
      graded understanding of progression patterns; self-modelling regression and 
      differential equation models have provided data-driven biomarker trajectories; 
      spatiotemporal models have shown that brain shape changes, for example of the 
      hippocampus, can occur before detectable neurodegeneration; and network models 
      have provided some support for prion-like mechanistic hypotheses of disease 
      propagation. The most mature results are in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, in 
      large part because of the availability of the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging 
      initiative dataset. Results generally support the prevailing amyloid-led 
      hypothetical model of Alzheimer's disease, while revealing finer detail and 
      insight into disease progression. SUMMARY: The emerging field of disease 
      progression modelling provides a natural mechanism to integrate different kinds 
      of information, for example from imaging, serum and cerebrospinal fluid markers 
      and cognitive tests, to obtain new insights into progressive diseases. Such 
      insights include fine-grained longitudinal patterns of neurodegeneration, from 
      early stages, and the heterogeneity of these trajectories over the population. 
      More pragmatically, such models enable finer precision in patient staging and 
      stratification, prediction of progression rates and earlier and better 
      identification of at-risk individuals. We argue that this will make disease 
      progression modelling invaluable for recruitment and end-points in future 
      clinical trials, potentially ameliorating the high failure rate in trials of, 
      e.g., Alzheimer's disease therapies. We review the state of the art in these 
      techniques and discuss the future steps required to translate the ideas to 
      front-line application.

AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) such as Alzheimer's (AD) and 
      Parkinson's (PD) are often diagnosed late, impeding effective treatment; 
      therefore, early detection is imperative. Modern methodologies can serve a 
      pivotal role in fulfilling the crucial need for timely detection and intervention 
      in this context. OBJECTIVES: Evaluate early detection's significance and 
      summarize key technologies (biomarkers, neuroimaging, AI/ML, genetics, digital 
      health) for enhanced diagnostic strategies in AD and PD. METHODS: This study 
      employs a focused descriptive review approach, encompassing analysis of 
      peer-reviewed articles and clinical trials from existing literature, to provide a 
      nuanced exploration of the subject matter. FINDINGS: This review underscores the 
      efficacy of non-invasive biomarkers, biosensors and emerging promising 
      technologies for advancing early diagnosis of AD and PD. CONCLUSION: The 
      landscape of early NDD detection has been reshaped by technology, yet challenges 
      persist, encompassing the domains of validation and ethics. A collaborative 
      effort between medical professionals, researchers and technologists is imperative 
      to effectively address and combat NDDs.

AB  - In this paper, we review state-of-the-art approaches that apply signal processing 
      (SP) and machine learning (ML) to automate the detection of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) and its prodromal stages. In the first part of the document, we describe the 
      economic and social implications of the disease, traditional diagnosis 
      techniques, and the fundaments of automated AD detection. Then, we present 
      electroencephalography (EEG) as an appropriate alternative for the early 
      detection of AD, owing to its reduced cost, portability, and non-invasiveness. We 
      also describe the main time and frequency domain EEG features that are employed 
      in AD detection. Subsequently, we examine some of the main studies of the last 
      decade that aim to provide an automatic detection of AD and its previous stages 
      by means of SP and ML. In these studies, brain data was acquired using multiple 
      medical techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission 
      tomography, and EEG. The main aspects of each approach, namely feature 
      extraction, classification model, validation approach, and performance metrics, 
      are compiled and discussed. Lastly, a set of conclusions and recommendations for 
      future research on AD automatic detection are drawn in the final section of the 
      paper.

PG  - 2577-2588

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (ND) are disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) 
      characterized by impairment in neurons' functions, and complete loss, leading to 
      memory loss, and difficulty in learning, language, and movement processes. The 
      most common among these NDs are Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD), although several other disorders also exist. These are frontotemporal 
      dementia (FTD), amyotrophic lateral syndrome (ALS), Huntington's disease (HD), 
      and others; the major pathological hallmark of NDs is the proteinopathies, either 
      of amyloid-β (Aβ), tauopathies, or synucleinopathies. Aggregation of proteins 
      that do not undergo normal configuration, either due to mutations or through some 
      disturbance in cellular pathway contributes to the diseases. Artificial 
      Intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) have proven to be successful in the 
      diagnosis and treatment of various congenital diseases. DL approaches like 
      AlphaFold (AF) are a major leap towards success in CNS disorders. This 3D protein 
      geometry modeling algorithm developed by DeepMind has the potential to 
      revolutionize biology. AF has the potential to predict 3D-protein confirmation at 
      an accuracy level comparable to experimentally predicted one, with the additional 
      advantage of precisely estimating protein interactions. This breakthrough will be 
      beneficial to identify diseases' advancement and the disturbance of signaling 
      pathways stimulating impaired functions of proteins. Though AlphaFold has solved 
      a major problem in structural biology, it cannot predict membrane proteins-a 
      beneficial approach for drug designing.

AB  - Locating remedies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been majorly restricted by the 
      inefficiency to establish a definitive detection model for early-stage diagnosis 
      of pathological events. This current lapse in AD diagnosis also limits the 
      therapeutic efficiency of the drugs, which might have been effective if given at 
      the earlier stages of the disease. The indicated situation directs towards the 
      burgeoned need for an effective biomarker technique that will help in early 
      detection of AD and would be imminently useful to facilitate improved diagnosis 
      and stimulate therapeutic trials. Till date, the major biomarkers, specifically 
      associated with AD detection, may help in determining the early-stage AD 
      diagnosis and identifying alterations in the cellular proteome, offering deeper 
      insight into disease etiology. Currently existing multidisciplinary clinical 
      diagnosis of AD is a very tedious, expensive procedure and requires highly 
      trained and skilled professionals who are rarely available outside the specialty 
      clinics. Mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) or Presenilin 1 and 2 
      (PSEN1 and PSEN2) are some biomarkers acting as critical checkpoints for AD 
      diagnosis. However, the presence of some associated biomarkers in cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) such as total-Tau (tTau), phosphorylated- Tau (pTau) 181 and 
      Amyloid-β (Aβ) 1-42 using structural or functional imaging techniques is 
      considered for confirmatory diagnosis of AD. Furthermore, the molecular diagnosis 
      of AD incorporates various sophisticated techniques including immuno-sensing, 
      machine learning, nano conjugation-based detections, etc. In the current review 
      description, we have summarized the various diagnostic approaches and their 
      relevance in mitigating the long-standing urgency of targeted diagnostic tools 
      for detection of AD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present work was to investigate the features of the 
      elderly population aged ≥65 yrs and with deteriorative mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) to establish a prediction model. METHODS: A 
      total of 105 patients aged ≥65 yrs and with MCI were followed up, with a 
      collection of 357 features, which were derived from the demographic 
      characteristics, hematological indicators (serum Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, P-tau and MCP-1 
      levels, APOE gene), and multimodal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) imaging 
      indicators of 116 brain regions (ADC, FA and CBF values). Cognitive function was 
      followed up for 2 yrs. Based on the Python platform Anaconda, 105 patients were 
      randomly divided into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%) by analyzing all 
      features through a random forest algorithm, and a prediction model was 
      established for the form of rapidly deteriorating MCI. RESULTS: Of the 105 
      patients enrolled, 41 deteriorated, and 64 did not come within 2 yrs. Model 1 was 
      established based on demographic characteristics, hematological indicators and 
      multi-modal MRI image features, the accuracy of the training set being 100%, the 
      accuracy of the test set 64%, sensitivity 50%, specificity 67%, and AUC 0.72. 
      Model 2 was based on the first five features (APOE4 gene, FA value of left 
      fusiform gyrus, FA value of left inferior temporal gyrus, FA value of left 
      parahippocampal gyrus, ADC value of right calcarine fissure as surrounding 
      cortex), the accuracy of the training set being 100%, the accuracy of the test 
      set 85%, sensitivity 91%, specificity 80% and AUC 0.96. Model 3 was based on the 
      first four features of Model 1, the accuracy of the training set is 100%, the 
      accuracy of the test set 97%, sensitivity100%, specificity 95% and AUC 0.99. 
      Model 4 was based on the first three characteristics of Model 1, the accuracy of 
      the training set being 100%, the accuracy of the test set 94%, sensitivity 92%, 
      specificity 94% and AUC 0.96. Model 5 was based on the hematological 
      characteristics, the accuracy of the training set is 100%, the accuracy of the 
      test set 91%, sensitivity 100%, specificity 88% and AUC 0.97. The models based on 
      the demographic characteristics, imaging characteristics FA, CBF and ADC values 
      had lower sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: Model 3, which has four 
      important predictive characteristics, can predict the rapidly deteriorating MCI 
      due to AD in the community.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) algorithms have found increasing utility in the medical 
      imaging field and numerous applications in the analysis of digital biomarkers 
      within positron emission tomography (PET) imaging have emerged. Interest in the 
      use of artificial intelligence in PET imaging for the study of neurodegenerative 
      diseases and oncology stems from the potential for such techniques to streamline 
      decision support for physicians providing early and accurate diagnosis and 
      allowing personalized treatment regimens. In this review, the use of ML to 
      improve PET image acquisition and reconstruction is presented, along with an 
      overview of its applications in the analysis of PET images for the study of 
      Alzheimer's disease and oncology.

TI  - Binswanger's disease: biomarkers in the inflammatory form of vascular cognitive 
      impairment and dementia.
PG  - 634-643
LID - 10.1111/jnc.14218 [doi]
AB  - Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a major public health 
      concern because of the increased incidence of vascular disease in the aging 
      population and the impact of vascular disease on Alzheimer's disease. VCID is a 
      heterogeneous group of diseases for which there are no proven treatments. 
      Biomarkers can be used to select more homogeneous populations. Small vessel 
      disease is the most prevalent form of VCID and is the optimal form for treatment 
      trials because there is a progressive course with characteristic pathological 
      changes. Subcortical ischemic vascular disease of the Binswanger type (SIVD-BD) 
      has a characteristic set of features that can be used both to identify patients 
      and to follow treatment. SIVD-BD patients have clinical, neuropsychological, 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging features that can be used as biomarkers. No 
      one feature is diagnostic, but a multimodal approach defines the SIVD-BD spectrum 
      disorder. The most important features are large white matter lesions with axonal 
      damage, blood-brain barrier disruption as shown by magnetic resonance imaging and 
      CSF, and neuropsychological evidence of executive dysfunction. We have used these 
      features to create a Binswanger Disease Scale and a probability of SIVD-BD, using 
      a machine-learning algorithm. The patients discussed in this review are derived 
      from published studies. Biomarkers not only aid in early diagnosis before the 
      disease process has progressed too far for treatment, but also can indicate 
      response to treatment. Refining the use of biomarkers will allow dementia 
      treatment to enter the era of precision medicine. This article is part of the 
      Special Issue "Vascular Dementia".

TI  - Analysis of long noncoding RNAs highlights region-specific altered expression 
      patterns and diagnostic roles in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 598-608

AB  - Increasing evidence has revealed the multiple roles of long noncoding RNAs 
      (lncRNAs) in neurodevelopment, brain function and aging, and their dysregulation 
      was implicated in many types of neurological diseases. However, expression 
      pattern and diagnostic role of lncRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remain largely 
      unknown and has gained significant attention. In this study, we performed a 
      comparative analysis for lncRNA expression profiles in four brain regions in 
      brain aging and AD. Our analysis revealed age- and disease-dependent 
      region-specific lncRNA expression patterns in aging and AD. Moreover, we 
      identified a panel of nine lncRNAs (termed LncSigAD9) in a discovery cohort of 
      114 samples using supervised machine learning and stepwise selection method. The 
      LncSigAD9 was able to differentiate between AD and healthy controls with high 
      diagnostic sensitivity and specificity both in the discovery cohort (86.3 and 
      89.5%) and the additional independent AD cohort (90.8 and 83.8%). The receiver 
      operating characteristic curves for the LncSigAD9 were 0.863 and 0.939 for 
      discovery and independent cohorts, respectively. Furthermore, the LncSigAD9 
      demonstrated higher diagnostic performance than nine-minus-one lncRNA signature 
      and mRNA-based signature with a similar number of genes. In silico functional 
      analysis indicated the involvement of lncRNA expression variation in brain 
      development- and metabolism-related biological processes. Taken together, our 
      study highlights the importance of lncRNAs in brain aging and AD, and 
      demonstrated the utility of lncRNAs as a promising biomarker for early AD 
      diagnosis and treatment.

      architectures for automated hippocampal segmentation have been increasingly 
      reported in neuroimaging research. Different hippocampal automated segmentation 
      methods can be of added value for the AD diagnostic work-up and treatment 
      planning. This study aims to conduct a thorough meta-analysis to evaluate the 
      segmentation accuracy and diagnostic performance of AI-assisted hippocampal 
      segmentation in AD and MCI. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, 
      and the Cochrane Library up to December 2024. Studies using neuroimaging data to 
      assess AI algorithms for hippocampal segmentation and diagnosis in AD or MCI 
      populations were included. Pooled segmentation accuracy was estimated using the 
      Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) through a random-effects model, while 
      diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve [AUC]) 
      was evaluated using a bivariate mixed-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 27 
      studies were included. For segmentation accuracy, pooled DSC values were 0.82 
      (95% CI: 0.80-0.85) for AD, 0.85 (0.83-0.88) for MCI, and 0.86 (0.84-0.88) for 
      normal controls (NC). Subgroup analyses indicated comparable performance between 
      left and right hippocampi (both DSC: 0.87). Diagnostic meta-analysis demonstrated 
      the highest accuracy for AD vs. NC (sensitivity: 0.87, specificity: 0.91, AUC: 
      0.95), but lower performance for AD vs. MCI (AUC: 0.80) and MCI vs. NC (AUC: 
      0.83). CONCLUSION: AI-assisted hippocampal segmentation achieves good accuracy 
      and demonstrates promising diagnostic capabilities for distinguishing AD from NC, 
      though differentiation between AD and MCI remains challenging. Future 
      high-quality research that applied standardized protocols, external validation, 
      and clinical integration is needed to improve reliability in clinical practice.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review explores the use of brain age estimation from MRI 
      scans as a biomarker of brain health. With disorders like Alzheimer's and 
      Parkinson's increasing globally, there is an urgent need for early detection 
      tools that can identify at-risk individuals before cognitive symptoms emerge. 
      Brain age offers a noninvasive, quantitative measure of neurobiological ageing, 
      with applications in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized 
      medicine. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies show that individuals with Alzheimer's, mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI), and Parkinson's have older brain ages than their 
      chronological age. Longitudinal research indicates that brain-predicted age 
      difference (brain-PAD) rises with disease progression and often precedes 
      cognitive decline. Advances in deep learning and multimodal imaging have improved 
      the accuracy and interpretability of brain age predictions. Moreover, 
      socioeconomic disparities and environmental factors significantly affect brain 
      aging, highlighting the need for inclusive models. SUMMARY: Brain age estimation 
      is a promising biomarker for identify future risk of neurodegenerative disease, 
      monitoring progression, and helping prognosis. Challenges like implementation of 
      standardization, demographic biases, and interpretability remain. Future research 
      should integrate brain age with biomarkers and multimodal imaging to enhance 
      early diagnosis and intervention strategies.

AB  - The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Internet of Medical 
      Things (IoMT) has revolutionized disease prediction and detection, but challenges 
      such as data heterogeneity, privacy concerns, and model generalizability hinder 
      its full potential in healthcare. This review examines these challenges and 
      evaluates the effectiveness of AI-IoMT techniques in predicting chronic and 
      terminal diseases, including cardiovascular conditions, Alzheimer's disease, and 
      cancers. We analyze a range of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) 
      approaches (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest, CNN, LSTM), alongside advanced 
      strategies like federated learning, transfer learning, and blockchain, to improve 
      model robustness, data security, and interoperability. Findings highlight that 
      transfer learning and ensemble methods enhance model adaptability across clinical 
      settings, while blockchain and federated learning effectively address privacy and 
      data standardization. Ultimately, the review emphasizes the importance of data 
      harmonization, secure frameworks, and multi-disease models as critical research 
      directions for scalable, comprehensive AI-IoMT solutions in healthcare.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To diagnose Alzheimer disease (AD), individuals are classified 
      according to the severity of their cognitive impairment. There are currently no 
      specific causes or conditions for this disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess AD prevalence across different 
      stages using machine learning (ML) approaches comprehensively. METHODS: The 
      selection of papers was conducted in 3 phases, as per PRISMA (Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) 2020 guidelines: identification, 
      screening, and final inclusion. The final analysis included 24 papers that met 
      the criteria. The selection of ML approaches for AD diagnosis was rigorously 
      based on their relevance to the investigation. The prevalence of patients with AD 
      at 2, 3, 4, and 6 stages was illustrated through the use of forest plots. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence rate for both cognitively normal (CN) and AD across 6 
      studies was 49.28% (95% CI 46.12%-52.45%; P=.32). The prevalence estimate for the 
      3 stages of cognitive impairment (CN, mild cognitive impairment, and AD) is 
      29.75% (95% CI 25.11%-34.84%, P<.001). Among 5 studies with 14,839 participants, 
      the analysis of 4 stages (nondemented, moderately demented, mildly demented, and 
      AD) found an overall prevalence of 13.13% (95% CI 3.75%-36.66%; P<.001). In 
      addition, 4 studies involving 3819 participants estimated the prevalence of 6 
      stages (CN, significant memory concern, early mild cognitive impairment, mild 
      cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD), yielding a 
      prevalence of 23.75% (95% CI 12.22%-41.12%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The significant 
      heterogeneity observed across studies reveals that demographic and setting 
      characteristics are responsible for the impact on AD prevalence estimates. This 
      study shows how ML approaches can be used to describe AD prevalence across 
      different stages, which provides valuable insights for future research.

AB  - We performed a systematic review of studies focusing on the automatic prediction 
      of the progression of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      dementia, and a quantitative analysis of the methodological choices impacting 
      performance. This review included 172 articles, from which 234 experiments were 
      extracted. For each of them, we reported the used data set, the feature types, 
      the algorithm type, performance and potential methodological issues. The impact 
      of these characteristics on the performance was evaluated using a multivariate 
      mixed effect linear regressions. We found that using cognitive, 
      fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography or potentially 
      electroencephalography and magnetoencephalography variables significantly 
      improved predictive performance compared to not including them, whereas including 
      other modalities, in particular T1 magnetic resonance imaging, did not show a 
      significant effect. The good performance of cognitive assessments questions the 
      wide use of imaging for predicting the progression to AD and advocates for 
      exploring further fine domain-specific cognitive assessments. We also identified 
      several methodological issues, including the absence of a test set, or its use 
      for feature selection or parameter tuning in nearly a fourth of the papers. Other 
      issues, found in 15% of the studies, cast doubts on the relevance of the method 
      to clinical practice. We also highlight that short-term predictions are likely 
      not to be better than predicting that subjects stay stable over time. These 
      issues highlight the importance of adhering to good practices for the use of 
      machine learning as a decision support system for the clinical practice.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of deep learning-assisted [(18)F]FDG PET imaging for 
      Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 3600-3612
LID - 10.1007/s00259-025-07228-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to calculate the diagnostic performance of deep learning 
      (DL)-assisted (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([(18)F]FDG) PET imaging in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). METHODS: The Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Web of Science Core 
      Collection, Cochrane, and IEEE Xplore databases were searched for related studies 
      from inception to May 24, 2024. We included original studies that developed a DL 
      algorithm for [(18)F]FDG PET imaging to assess diagnostic performance in 
      classifying AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal control (NC). A 
      bivariate random-effects model was employed to assess the area under the curve 
      (AUC). RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of 
      these, 35 studies distinguished AD from NC, with a pooled AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 
      0.96-0.99). Thirteen studies distinguished AD from MCI, with a pooled AUC of 0.95 
      (95% CI: 0.92-0.96). Nineteen studies distinguished MCI from NC, with a pooled 
      AUC of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95). Additionally, we found large amounts of 
      heterogeneity across studies which could be partially attributed to variations in 
      DL methods and imaging modalities. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and 
      meta-analysis shows that DL-assisted [(18)F]FDG PET imaging has high diagnostic 
      performance in identifying AD. The significant heterogeneity among studies 
      underscores the necessity for future research to incorporate external validation, 
      utilize large sample size, and adhere to rigorous guideline to provide robust 
      support for clinical decision-making.

TI  - Facial expression deep learning algorithms in the detection of neurological 
      disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1186/s12938-025-01396-3 [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurological disorders, ranging from common conditions like 
      Alzheimer's disease that is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and remains 
      the most common cause of dementia worldwide to rare disorders such as Angelman 
      syndrome, impose a significant global health burden. Altered facial expressions 
      are a common symptom across these disorders, potentially serving as a diagnostic 
      indicator. Deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks 
      (CNNs), have shown promise in detecting these facial expression changes, aiding 
      in diagnosing and monitoring neurological conditions. OBJECTIVES: This systematic 
      review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the performance of deep learning 
      algorithms in detecting facial expression changes for diagnosing neurological 
      disorders. METHODS: Following PRISMA2020 guidelines, we systematically searched 
      PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published up to August 2024. Data 
      from 28 studies were extracted, and the quality was assessed using the JBI 
      checklist. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate pooled accuracy estimates. 
      Subgroup analyses were conducted based on neurological disorders, and 
      heterogeneity was evaluated using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: The meta-analysis 
      included 24 studies from 2019 to 2024, with neurological conditions such as 
      dementia, Bell's palsy, ALS, and Parkinson's disease assessed. The overall pooled 
      accuracy was 89.25% (95% CI 88.75-89.73%). High accuracy was found for dementia 
      (99%) and Bell's palsy (93.7%), while conditions such as ALS and stroke had lower 
      accuracy (73.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, show 
      strong potential in detecting facial expression changes for neurological 
      disorders. However, further work is needed to standardize data sets and improve

AB  - The gut-brain axis (GBA) is a biochemical link that connects the central nervous 
      system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS). Clinical and experimental evidence 
      suggests gut microbiota as a key regulator of the GBA. Microbes living in the gut 
      not only interact locally with intestinal cells and the ENS but have also been 
      found to modulate the CNS through neuroendocrine and metabolic pathways. Studies 
      have also explored the involvement of gut microbiota dysbiosis in depression, 
      anxiety, autism, stroke, and pathophysiology of other neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Recent reports suggest that microbe-derived metabolites can influence host 
      metabolism by acting as epigenetic regulators. Butyrate, an intestinal bacterial 
      metabolite, is a known histone deacetylase inhibitor that has shown to improve 
      learning and memory in animal models. Due to high disease variability amongst the 
      population, a multi-omics approach that utilizes artificial intelligence and 
      machine learning to analyze and integrate omics data is necessary to better 
      understand the role of the GBA in pathogenesis of neurological disorders, to 
      generate predictive models, and to develop precise and personalized therapeutics. 
      This review examines our current understanding of epigenetic regulation of the 
      GBA and proposes a framework to integrate multi-omics data for prediction, 
      prevention, and development of precision health approaches to treat brain 
      disorders.

AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in neurology is a growing field 
      offering opportunities to improve accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of 
      complicated neuronal disorders, plus fostering a deeper understanding of the 
      aetiologies of these diseases through AI-based analyses of large omics data. The 
      most common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease (AD), is characterized 
      by brain accumulation of specific pathological proteins, accompanied by cognitive 
      impairment. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the use of AI in 
      different AD-related fields, such as analysis of neuroimaging data enabling early 
      and accurate AD diagnosis; prediction of AD progression, identification of 
      patients at higher risk and evaluation of new treatments; improvement of the 
      evaluation of drug response using AI algorithms to analyze patient clinical and 
      neuroimaging data; the development of personalized AD therapies; and the use of 
      AI-based techniques to improve the quality of daily life of AD patients and their 
      caregivers.

AB  - With the advances in technology and data science, machine learning (ML) is being 
      rapidly adopted by the health care sector. However, there is a lack of literature 
      addressing the health conditions targeted by the ML prediction models within 
      primary health care (PHC) to date. To fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a 
      systematic review following the PRISMA guidelines to identify health conditions 
      targeted by ML in PHC. We searched the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, 
      Elsevier, BioRxiv, Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and IEEE Xplore 
      databases for studies published from January 1990 to January 2022. We included 
      primary studies addressing ML diagnostic or prognostic predictive models that 
      were supplied completely or partially by real-world PHC data. Studies selection, 
      data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using the prediction model study 
      risk of bias assessment tool were performed by two investigators. Health 
      conditions were categorized according to international classification of diseases 
      (ICD-10). Extracted data were analyzed quantitatively. We identified 106 studies 
      investigating 42 health conditions. These studies included 207 ML prediction 
      models supplied by the PHC data of 24.2 million participants from 19 countries. 
      We found that 92.4% of the studies were retrospective and 77.3% of the studies 
      reported diagnostic predictive ML models. A majority (76.4%) of all the studies 
      were for models' development without conducting external validation. Risk of bias 
      assessment revealed that 90.8% of the studies were of high or unclear risk of 
      bias. The most frequently reported health conditions were diabetes mellitus 
      (19.8%) and Alzheimer's disease (11.3%). Our study provides a summary on the 
      presently available ML prediction models within PHC. We draw the attention of 
      digital health policy makers, ML models developer, and health care professionals 
      for more future interdisciplinary research collaboration in this regard.

AB  - Several (inter)national longitudinal dementia observational datasets encompassing 
      demographic information, neuroimaging, biomarkers, neuropsychological 
      evaluations, and muti-omics data, have ushered in a new era of potential for 
      integrating machine learning (ML) into dementia research and clinical practice. 
      ML, with its proficiency in handling multi-modal and high-dimensional data, has 
      emerged as an innovative technique to facilitate early diagnosis, differential 
      diagnosis, and to predict onset and progression of mild cognitive impairment and 
      dementia. In this review, we evaluate current and potential applications of ML, 
      including its history in dementia research, how it compares to traditional 
      statistics, the types of datasets it uses and the general workflow. Moreover, we 
      identify the technical barriers and challenges of ML implementations in clinical 
      practice. Overall, this review provides a comprehensive understanding of ML with 
      non-technical explanations for broader accessibility to biomedical scientists and 
      clinicians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Together with the Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease is 
      considered as one of the two serious known neurodegenerative diseases. Physicians 
      find it hard to predict whether a given patient has already developed or is 
      expected to develop the Parkinson's disease in the future. To overcome this 
      difficulty, it is possible to develop a computing model, which analyzes the data 
      related to a given patient and predicts with acceptable accuracy when he/she is 
      anticipated to develop the Parkinson's disease. OBJECTIVES: This paper 
      contributes an attractive prediction framework based on some machine learning 
      approaches for distinguishing people with Parkinsonism from healthy individuals. 
      METHODS: Several fuzzy classifiers such as Inductive Fuzzy Classifier, Fuzzy 
      Rough Classifier and two types of neuro-fuzzy classifiers have been employed. 
      RESULTS: The fuzzy classifiers utilized in this study have been tested using the 
      "Parkinson Speech Dataset with Multiple Types of Sound Recordings Data Set" of 40 
      subjects available on the UCI repository. CONCLUSION: The results achieved show 
      that FURIA, MLP- Bagging - SGD, genfis2 and scg1 performed the best among the 
      fuzzy rough, WEKA, adaptive neuro-fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy classifiers, 
      respectively. The worst performance belongs to nearest neighborhood, IBK, genfis3 
      and scg3 among the formerly mentioned classifiers. The results reported in this 
      paper are better in comparison to the results reported in Sakar et al., where the 
      same dataset was used, with utilization of different classifiers. This 
      demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of the fuzzy classifiers used in 
      this study as compared to the non-fuzzy classifiers used by Sakar et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence shows that indicators testing conventional olfactory 
      function have a high degree of similarity to cognitive function tests and the 
      potential to diagnose early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, the 
      efficacy of functional near-infrared spectroscopy time-series data obtained 
      through olfactory stimulation was investigated as an early diagnostic tool for 
      mild cognitive impairment in AD using random forest, a machine learning 
      algorithm. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a patient-level, single-group, 
      diagnostic interventional trial using near-infrared signals measured during 
      olfactory stimulation in the prefrontal cortex of 178 older adults ranging from 
      normal to participants with AD as markers to discriminate AD stages. We first 
      divided the participants into normal older adults, AD mild cognitive impairment, 
      and AD groups using dementia diagnostic criteria such as the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination and Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery. We compared the left 
      and right oxygenation difference by calculating the relative oxygenation 
      difference from the change in relative oxygen concentration. RESULTS: A total of 
      168 participants met the eligibility criteria: 70 (41.6%) had normal cognitive 
      function; 42 (25%) mild cognitive impairment; 21 (12.5%) mild AD; and 35 (20.8%) 
      moderate AD. A random forest machine learning model was developed to predict the 
      AD stage, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90.7% 
      for mild cognitive impairment and AD, 90.99% for mild cognitive impairment, and 
      93.34% for AD only. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the classification of the oxygenation 
      difference index of the left and right prefrontal cortices during olfactory 
      stimulation through machine learning, we found that it was possible to detect 
      early-stage mild cognitive impairment in AD. Our results highlight the potential 
      for early AD diagnosis using near-infrared signals from the prefrontal cortex 
      obtained upon olfactory stimulation. Moreover, the results showed high similarity 
      to the existing cognitive function tests and high accuracy in AD stage 
      classification.

TI  - The Emerging Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs and MicroRNAs in Neurodegenerative 
      Diseases: A Perspective of Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/biom11081132 [doi]
LID - 1132
AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are characterized by progressive neuronal 
      dysfunction and death of brain cells population. As the early manifestations of 
      NDs are similar, their symptoms are difficult to distinguish, making the timely 
      detection and discrimination of each neurodegenerative disorder a priority. 
      Several investigations have revealed the importance of microRNAs and long 
      non-coding RNAs in neurodevelopment, brain function, maturation, and neuronal 
      activity, as well as its dysregulation involved in many types of neurological 
      diseases. Therefore, the expression pattern of these molecules in the different 
      NDs have gained significant attention to improve the diagnostic and treatment at 
      earlier stages. In this sense, we gather the different microRNAs and long 
      non-coding RNAs that have been reported as dysregulated in each disorder. Since 
      there are a vast number of non-coding RNAs altered in NDs, some sort of 
      synthesis, filtering and organization method should be applied to extract the 
      most relevant information. Hence, machine learning is considered as an important 
      tool for this purpose since it can classify expression profiles of non-coding 
      RNAs between healthy and sick people. Therefore, we deepen in this branch of 
      computer science, its different methods, and its meaningful application in the 
      diagnosis of NDs from the dysregulated non-coding RNAs. In addition, we 
      demonstrate the relevance of machine learning in NDs from the description of 
      different investigations that showed an accuracy between 85% to 95% in the 
      detection of the disease with this tool. All of these denote that artificial 
      intelligence could be an excellent alternative to help the clinical diagnosis and 
      facilitate the identification diseases in early stages based on non-coding RNAs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tau pathology correlates with and predicts clinical decline in 
      Alzheimer's disease. Approved tau-targeted therapies are not available. METHODS: 
      ADAMANT, a 24-month randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
      double-blinded, multicenter, Phase 2 clinical trial (EudraCT2015-000630-30, 
      NCT02579252) enrolled 196 participants with Alzheimer's disease; 119 are included 
      in this post-hoc subgroup analysis. AADvac1, active immunotherapy against 
      pathological tau protein. A machine learning model predicted likely 
      Amyloid+Tau+ participants from baseline MRI. STATISTICAL METHODS: MMRM for change 
      from baseline in cognition, function, and neurodegeneration; linear regression 
      for associations between antibody response and endpoints. RESULTS: The prediction 
      model achieved PPV of 97.7% for amyloid, 96.2% for tau. 119 participants in the 
      full analysis set (70 treatment and 49 placebo) were classified as A+T+. A trend 
      for CDR-SB 104-week change (estimated marginal means [emm] = -0.99 points, 95% CI 
      [-2.13, 0.13], p = 0.0825]) and ADCS-MCI-ADL (emm = 3.82 points, CI [-0.29, 
      7.92], p = 0.0679) in favour of the treatment group was seen. Reduction was seen 
      in plasma NF-L (emm = -0.15 log pg/mL, CI [-0.27, -0.03], p = 0.0139). Higher 
      antibody response to AADvac1 was related to slowing of decline on CDR-SB 
      (rho = -0.10, CI [-0.21, 0.01], p = 0.0376) and ADL (rho = 0.15, CI [0.03, 0.27], 
      p = 0.0201), and related to slower brain atrophy (rho = 0.18-0.35, p < 0.05 for 
      temporal volume, whole cortex, and right and left hippocampus). CONCLUSIONS: In 
      the subgroup of ML imputed or CSF identified A+T+, AADvac1 slowed AD-related 
      decline in an antibody-dependent manner. Larger anti-tau trials are warranted.

      progress slowly, whereas aging of the vasculature also can begin in midlife, 
      continuing to progress into old age, making mixed dementia the most common type 
      of dementia. Biomarkers facilitate the early diagnosis of dementias. It is 
      possible to diagnose mixed dementia before autopsy with biomarkers for vascular 
      disease derived from diffusor tensor images on magnetic resonance imaging and 
      Alzheimer disease proteins, Aβ (amyloid β), and phosphorylated tau, in 
      cerebrospinal fluid or in brain with positron emission tomography. The presence 
      of vascular disease accelerates cognitive decline. Both misfolded proteins and 
      vascular disease promote inflammation, which can be detected in cerebrospinal 
      fluid by the presence of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases), angiogenic growth 
      factors, and cytokines. MMPs disrupt the blood-brain barrier and break down 
      myelin, producing Binswanger disease's 2 main pathological features. Advances in 
      detecting biomarkers in plasma will provide early detection of dementia and aided 
      by machine learning and artificial intelligence, will enhance diagnosis and form 
      the basis for early treatments.

AB  - DNA methylation is an important mode of regulation in epigenetic mechanisms, and 
      it is one of the research foci in the field of epigenetics. DNA methylation 
      modification affects a series of biological processes, such as eukaryotic cell 
      growth, differentiation, and transformation mechanisms, by regulating gene 
      expression. In this review, we systematically summarized the DNA methylation 
      databases, prediction tools for DNA methylation modification, machine learning 
      algorithms for predicting DNA methylation modification, and the relationship 
      between DNA methylation modification and diseases such as hypertension, 
      Alzheimer's disease, diabetic nephropathy, and cancer. An in-depth understanding 
      of DNA methylation mechanisms can promote accurate prediction of DNA methylation 
      modifications and the treatment and diagnosis of related diseases.

AB  - This comprehensive review examines the integration of Quantitative 
      Electroencephalography (qEEG) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the detection 
      and diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Through systematic analysis of 11 key 
      studies across multiple international databases, we evaluated various AI 
      architectures, including machine learning algorithms and deep learning networks, 
      applied to qEEG data for AD detection. The review encompasses studies with 
      diverse subject populations, ranging from 35 to 890 participants, with mean ages 
      between 66.94 and 74.8 years. Results demonstrate that AI-enhanced qEEG analysis 
      achieves remarkable diagnostic accuracy, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) 
      reaching 93.18% accuracy and 97.92% Area Under Curve (AUC). Convolutional Neural 
      Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) also showed promising results, 
      with some models achieving up to 100% sensitivity in specific classifications. 
      The integration of multiple data types and advanced feature extraction methods 
      significantly improved diagnostic precision. Geographic diversity in research 
      origins, spanning from Asia to Europe and the Americas, provides robust 
      cross-cultural validation of findings. However, challenges persist in data 
      quality, computational resources, and standardization of methodologies. This 
      review highlights the significant potential of AI-enhanced qEEG as a 
      non-invasive, cost-effective tool for the diagnosis of AD in its prodromal and 
      dementia stages, while also identifying areas requiring further research to 
      optimize its clinical application. These findings suggest that AI-enhanced qEEG 
      analysis could revolutionize AD diagnosis, enabling earlier intervention and 
      improved patient outcomes.

      Imaging Modalities in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
PG  - 198-207
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a very active Computer Science research field 
      aiming to develop systems that mimic human intelligence and is helpful in many 
      human activities, including Medicine. In this review we presented some examples 
      of the exploiting of AI techniques, in particular automatic classifiers such as 
      Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification 
      Tree (ClT) and ensemble methods like Random Forest (RF), able to analyze findings 
      obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission 
      tomography (SPECT) scans of patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases, in 
      particular Alzheimer's Disease. We also focused our attention on techniques 
      applied in order to preprocess data and reduce their dimensionality via feature 
      selection or projection in a more representative domain (Principal Component 
      Analysis - PCA - or Partial Least Squares - PLS - are examples of such methods); 
      this is a crucial step while dealing with medical data, since it is necessary to 
      compress patient information and retain only the most useful in order to 
      discriminate subjects into normal and pathological classes. Main literature 
      papers on the application of these techniques to classify patients with 
      neurodegenerative disease extracting data from molecular imaging modalities are 
      reported, showing that the increasing development of computer aided diagnosis 
      systems is very promising to contribute to the diagnostic process.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognition 
      and is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. As the number of elderly 
      individuals increases globally, the incidence and prevalence of AD are expected 
      to increase. At present, AD is diagnosed clinically, according to accepted 
      criteria. The essential elements in the diagnosis of AD include a patients 
      history, a physical examination and neuropsychological testing, in addition to 
      appropriate investigations such as neuroimaging. The omics-based approach is an 
      emerging field of study that may not only aid in the diagnosis of AD but also 
      facilitate the exploration of factors that influence the development of the 
      disease. Omics techniques, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 
      metabolomics, may reveal the pathways that lead to neuronal death and identify 
      biomolecular markers associated with AD. This will further facilitate an 
      understanding of AD neuropathology. In this review, omics-based approaches that 
      were implemented in studies on AD were assessed from a bioinformatics 
      perspective. Current state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning approaches 
      used in the single omics analysis of AD were compared based on correlations of 
      variants, differential expression, functional analysis and network analysis. This 
      was followed by a review of the approaches used in the integration and analysis 
      of multi-omics of AD. The strengths and limitations of multi-omics analysis 
      methods were explored and the issues and challenges associated with omics studies 
      of AD were highlighted. Lastly, future studies in this area of research were 
      justified.

AB  - Cerebrovascular morphology plays a critical role in brain health, influencing 
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) and contributing to the pathogenesis of various 
      neurological diseases. This review examines the anatomical structure of the 
      cerebrovascular network and its variations in healthy and diseased populations 
      and highlights age-related changes and their implications in various neurological 
      conditions. Normal variations, including the completeness and anatomical 
      anomalies of the Circle of Willis and collateral circulation, are discussed in 
      relation to their impact on CBF and susceptibility to ischemic events. 
      Age-related changes in the cerebrovascular system, such as alterations in vessel 
      geometry and density, are explored for their contributions to age-related 
      neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. 
      Advances in medical imaging and computational methods have enabled automatic 
      quantitative assessment of cerebrovascular structures, facilitating the 
      identification of pathological changes in both acute and chronic cerebrovascular 
      disorders. Emerging technologies, including machine learning and computational 
      fluid dynamics, offer new tools for predicting disease risk and patient outcomes 
      based on vascular morphology. This review underscores the importance of 
      understanding cerebrovascular remodeling for early diagnosis and the development 
      of novel therapeutic approaches in brain diseases.

TI  - Review of MR spectroscopy analysis and artificial intelligence applications for 
      the detection of cerebral inflammation and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 102-110
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) has an emerging role as a 
      neuroimaging tool for the detection of biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To 
      date, MRS has been established as one of the diagnostic tools for various 
      diseases such as breast cancer and fatty liver, as well as brain tumours. 
      However, its utility in neurodegenerative diseases is still in the experimental 
      stages. The potential role of the modality has not been fully explored, as there 
      is diverse information regarding the aberrations in the brain metabolites caused 
      by normal ageing versus neurodegenerative disorders. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      literature search was carried out to gather eligible studies from the following 
      widely sourced electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed and Google Scholar 
      using the combination of the following keywords: AD, MRS, brain metabolites, deep 
      learning (DL), machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI); having the 
      aim of taking the readers through the advancements in the usage of MRS analysis 
      and related AI applications for the detection of AD. RESULTS: We elaborate on the 
      MRS data acquisition, processing, analysis, and interpretation techniques. 
      Recommendation is made for MRS parameters that can obtain the best quality 
      spectrum for fingerprinting the brain metabolomics composition in AD. 
      Furthermore, we summarise ML and DL techniques that have been utilised to 
      estimate the uncertainty in the machine-predicted metabolite content, as well as 
      streamline the process of displaying results of metabolites derangement that 
      occurs as part of ageing. CONCLUSION: MRS has a role as a non-invasive tool for 
      the detection of brain metabolite biomarkers that indicate brain metabolic 
      health, which can be integral in the management of AD.

AB  - Neuroimaging has made it possible to measure pathological brain changes 
      associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. Over the past decade, these 
      measures have been increasingly integrated into imaging signatures of AD by means 
      of classification frameworks, offering promising tools for individualized 
      diagnosis and prognosis. We reviewed neuroimaging-based studies for AD and mild 
      cognitive impairment classification, selected after online database searches in 
      Google Scholar and PubMed (January, 1985-June, 2016). We categorized these 
      studies based on the following neuroimaging modalities (and sub-categorized based 
      on features extracted as a post-processing step from these modalities): i) 
      structural magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] (tissue density, cortical surface, 
      and hippocampal measurements), ii) functional MRI (functional coherence of 
      different brain regions, and the strength of the functional connectivity), iii) 
      diffusion tensor imaging (patterns along the white matter fibers), iv) 
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) (metabolic rate of 
      cerebral glucose), and v) amyloid-PET (amyloid burden). The studies reviewed 
      indicate that the classification frameworks formulated on the basis of these 
      features show promise for individualized diagnosis and prediction of clinical 
      progression. Finally, we provided a detailed account of AD classification 
      challenges and addressed some future research directions.

TI  - Data-driven modelling of neurodegenerative disease progression: thinking outside 
      the black box.
PG  - 111-130
LID - 10.1038/s41583-023-00779-6 [doi]
AB  - Data-driven disease progression models are an emerging set of computational tools 
      that reconstruct disease timelines for long-term chronic diseases, providing 
      unique insights into disease processes and their underlying mechanisms. Such 
      methods combine a priori human knowledge and assumptions with large-scale data 
      processing and parameter estimation to infer long-term disease trajectories from 
      short-term data. In contrast to 'black box' machine learning tools, data-driven 
      disease progression models typically require fewer data and are inherently 
      interpretable, thereby aiding disease understanding in addition to enabling 
      classification, prediction and stratification. In this Review, we place the 
      current landscape of data-driven disease progression models in a general 
      framework and discuss their enhanced utility for constructing a disease timeline 
      compared with wider machine learning tools that construct static disease 
      profiles. We review the insights they have enabled across multiple 
      neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer disease, for applications such as 
      determining temporal trajectories of disease biomarkers, testing hypotheses about 
      disease mechanisms and uncovering disease subtypes. We outline key areas for 
      technological development and translation to a broader range of neuroscience and 
      non-neuroscience applications. Finally, we discuss potential pathways and 
      barriers to integrating disease progression models into clinical practice and 
      trial settings.

TI  - Unveiling New Strategies Facilitating the Implementation of Artificial 
      Intelligence in Neuroimaging for the Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.3233/JAD-231135 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder with a global 
      impact. The past few decades have witnessed significant strides in comprehending 
      the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and developing diagnostic 
      methodologies for AD, such as neuroimaging approaches. Neuroimaging techniques, 
      including positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, have 
      revolutionized the field by providing valuable insights into the structural and 
      functional alterations in the brains of individuals with AD. These imaging 
      modalities enable the detection of early biomarkers such as amyloid-β plaques and 
      tau protein tangles, facilitating early and precise diagnosis. Furthermore, the 
      emerging technologies encompassing blood-based biomarkers and neurochemical 
      profiling exhibit promising results in the identification of specific molecular 
      signatures for AD. The integration of machine learning algorithms and artificial 
      intelligence has enhanced the predictive capacity of these diagnostic tools when 
      analyzing complex datasets. In this review article, we will highlight not only 
      some of the most used diagnostic imaging approaches in neurodegeneration research 
      but focus much more on new tools like artificial intelligence, emphasizing their 
      application in the realm of AD. These advancements hold immense potential for 
      early detection and intervention, thereby paving the way for personalized 
      therapeutic strategies and ultimately augmenting the quality of life for 
      individuals affected by AD.

AB  - Lipids are essential for cellular functioning considering their role in membrane 
      composition, signaling, and energy metabolism. The brain is the second most 
      abundant organ in terms of lipid concentration and diversity only after adipose 
      tissue. However, in the central system (CNS) lipid dysregulation has been linked 
      to the etiology, progression, and severity of neurodegenerative diseases such as 
      Alzheimeŕs, Parkinson, and Multiple Sclerosis. Advances in the human genome and 
      subsequent sequencing technologies allowed us the study of lipidomics as a 
      promising approach to diagnosis and treatment of neurodegeneration. Lipidomics 
      advances rapidly increased the amount and quality of data allowing the 
      integration with other omic types as well as implementing novel bioinformatic and 
      quantitative tools such as machine learning (ML). Integration of lipidomics data 
      with ML, as a powerful quantitative predictive approach, led to improvements in 
      diagnostic biomarker prediction, clinical data integration, network, and systems 
      approaches for neural behavior, novel etiology markers for inflammation, and 
      neurodegeneration progression and even Mass Spectrometry image analysis. In this 
      sense, by exploiting lipidomics data with ML is possible to improve the 
      identification of new biomarkers or unveil new molecular mechanisms associated 
      with lipid impairment across neurodegeneration. In this review, we present the 
      lipidomic neurobiology state-of-the-art highlighting its potential applications 
      to study neurodegenerative conditions. Also, we present theoretical background, 
      applications, and advances in the integration of lipidomics with ML. This review 
      opens the door to new approaches in this rising field.

AB  - Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is a pathological condition characterized by 
      significant loss of hippocampal neurons and gliosis. This condition represents 
      the most common neuropathological change observed in patients with temporal lobe 
      epilepsy (TLE) and is also found in aging individuals. TLE related to HS is the 
      most prevalent type of drug-resistant epilepsy in adults, and its underlying 
      mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Therefore, developing improved methods 
      for predicting and treating drug-resistant patients with TLE-HS is crucial. 
      Patients with TLE-HS often experience cognitive impairment and psychological 
      comorbidities, significantly affecting their quality of life. Consequently, a 
      thorough review of the current research status of TLE-HS is essential, focusing 
      on its prediction, diagnosis, treatment, and underlying mechanisms. The 
      hippocampus plays a pivotal role in memory and cognition. HS of aging (HS-Aging), 
      a condition linked to dementia in the ultra-elderly, is marked by severe CA1 
      (cornu ammonis) neuronal loss and frequent transactive response DNA-binding 
      protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy, often misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD). Nonetheless, clinical characteristics and patterns of hippocampal 
      atrophy can help differentiate between the two disorders. This review aims to 
      provide a comprehensive overview of the pathological features of HS, the relevant 
      mechanisms underlying TLE-HS and HS-Aging, current imaging diagnostic techniques, 
      including machine learning, and available treatment modalities. It also explores 
      the prognosis and comorbidities related to these conditions. Future research 
      directions include establishing animal models to clarify the poorly understood 
      mechanisms underlying HS, particularly those related to emotional processing. 
      Investigating post-HS behavioral and cognitive changes in these models will lay 
      the foundation for further advancements in this field. This review is a 
      cornerstone for future investigations and suggests additional research endeavors.

      Comprehensive Review.
PG  - e20240008

AB  - The numerous and varied forms of neurodegenerative illnesses provide a 
      considerable challenge to contemporary healthcare. The emergence of artificial 
      intelligence has fundamentally changed the diagnostic picture by providing 
      effective and early means of identifying these crippling illnesses. As a subset 
      of computational intelligence, machine-learning algorithms have become very 
      effective tools for the analysis of large datasets that include genetic, imaging, 
      and clinical data. Moreover, multi-modal data integration, which includes 
      information from brain imaging (MRI, PET scans), genetic profiles, and clinical 
      evaluations, is made easier by computational intelligence. A thorough knowledge 
      of the course of the illness is made possible by this consolidative method, which 
      also facilitates the creation of predictive models for early medical evaluation 
      and outcome prediction. Furthermore, there has been a great deal of promise shown 
      by the use of artificial intelligence to neuroimaging analysis. Sophisticated 
      image processing methods combined with machine learning algorithms make it 
      possible to identify functional and structural anomalies in the brain, which 
      often act as early indicators of neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter 
      examines how computational intelligence plays a critical role in improving the 
      diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, etc. To 
      sum up, computational intelligence provides a revolutionary approach for 
      improving the identification of neurodegenerative illnesses. In the battle 
      against these difficult disorders, embracing and improving these computational 
      techniques will surely pave the path for more individualized therapy and more 
      therapies that are successful.

AB  - The rapid growth in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has led to an unprecedented 
      accumulation of biomedical and clinical data, including longitudinal patient 
      datasets and comprehensive observational cohort databases comprising clinical, 
      biomedical, neuroimaging and lifestyle data. Expert use of machine learning 
      algorithms is indispensable in order to realize the full potential of the data 
      for diagnosis and drug target discovery. Here, we provide an overview of the 
      biomedical and neuroimaging measures for AD diagnosis and staging. We then 
      critically review the application of machine learning (classification) methods to 
      AD data and provide insight for future improvements and research directions. 
      Future research should aim to improve interpretability, accessibility and 
      thorough validation of the models, enabling translation into clinical 
      applications.

TI  - Thought on Food: A Systematic Review of Current Approaches and Challenges for 
      Food Intake Detection.
LID - 10.3390/s22176443 [doi]
LID - 6443
AB  - Nowadays, individuals have very stressful lifestyles, affecting their nutritional 
      habits. In the early stages of life, teenagers begin to exhibit bad habits and 
      inadequate nutrition. Likewise, other people with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, 
      or other conditions may not take food or medicine regularly. Therefore, the 
      ability to monitor could be beneficial for them and for the doctors that can 
      analyze the patterns of eating habits and their correlation with overall health. 
      Many sensors help accurately detect food intake episodes, including 
      electrogastrography, cameras, microphones, and inertial sensors. Accurate 
      detection may provide better control to enable healthy nutrition habits. This 
      paper presents a systematic review of the use of technology for food intake 
      detection, focusing on the different sensors and methodologies used. The search 
      was performed with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework that helps 
      screen irrelevant studies while following the PRISMA methodology. It 
      automatically searched and filtered the research studies in different databases, 
      including PubMed, Springer, ACM, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, and Elsevier. Then, the 
      manual analysis selected 30 papers based on the results of the framework for 
      further analysis, which support the interest in using sensors for food intake 
      detection and nutrition assessment. The mainly used sensors are cameras, 
      inertial, and acoustic sensors that handle the recognition of food intake 
      episodes with artificial intelligence techniques. This research identifies the 
      most used sensors and data processing methodologies to detect food intake.

TI  - Is EEG Entropy a Useful Measure for Alzheimer's Disease?
PG  - 347-364
LID - 10.62641/aep.v52i3.1632 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has 
      increased, and it is estimated to continue rising in the coming years. The 
      diagnosis of this disease is challenging due to variations in onset and course, 
      its diverse clinical manifestations, and the indications for measuring deposit 
      biomarkers. Hence, there is a need to develop more precise and less invasive 
      diagnostic tools. Multiple studies have considered using electroencephalography 
      (EEG) entropy measures as an indicator of the onset and course of AD. Entropy is 
      deemed suitable as a potential indicator based on the discovery that variations 
      in its complexity can be associated with specific pathologies such as AD. 
      METHODOLOGY: Following PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted in 4 
      scientific databases, and 40 articles were analyzed after discarding and 
      filtering. RESULTS: There is a diversity in entropy measures; however, Sample 
      Entropy (SampEn) and Multiscale Entropy (MSE) are the most widely used (21/40). 
      In general, it is found that when comparing patients with controls, patients 
      exhibit lower entropy (20/40) in various areas. Findings of correlation with the 
      level of cognitive decline are less consistent, and with neuropsychiatric 
      symptoms (2/40) or treatment response less explored (2/40), although most studies 
      show lower entropy with greater severity. Machine learning-based studies show 
      good discrimination capacity. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant difficulty in 
      comparing multiple studies due to their heterogeneity; however, changes in 
      Multiscale Entropy (MSE) scales or a decrease in entropy levels are considered 
      useful for determining the presence of AD and measuring its severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The incidence of Alzheimer's disease is rising with the 
      increasing elderly population worldwide. While no cure exists, early diagnosis 
      can significantly slow disease progression. Computer-aided diagnostic systems are 
      becoming critical tools for assisting in the early detection of Alzheimer's 
      disease. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate recent advancements in 
      computer-aided decision support systems for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, 
      focusing on data modalities, machine learning methods, and performance metrics. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items 
      for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published between 
      2021 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, IEEEXplore and Web of Science, using 
      search terms related to Alzheimer's disease classification, neuroimaging, machine 
      learning, and diagnostic performance. A total of 39 studies met the inclusion 
      criteria, focusing on the use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission 
      Tomography, and biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease classification using machine 
      learning models. RESULTS: Multimodal approaches, combining Magnetic Resonance 
      Imaging with Positron Emission Tomography and Cognitive assessments, outperformed 
      single-modality studies in diagnostic accuracy reliability. Convolutional Neural 
      Networks were the most commonly used machine learning models, followed by hybrid 
      models and Random Forest. The highest accuracy reported for binary classification 
      was 100%, while multi-class classification achieved up to 99.98%. Techniques like 
      Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique and data augmentation were frequently 
      employed to handle data imbalance, improving model generalizability. DISCUSSION: 
      Our review highlights the advantages of using multimodal data in computer-aided 
      decision support systems for more accurate Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. 
      However, we also identified several limitations, including data imbalance, small 
      sample sizes, and the lack of external validation in most studies. Future 
      research should utilize larger, more diverse datasets, include longitudinal data, 
      and validate models in real-world clinical trials. Additionally, explainability 
      is needed in machine learning models to ensure they are interpretable and 
      reliable in clinical settings. CONCLUSION: While computer-aided decision support 
      systems show significant promise in improving the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
      disease, further work is needed to enhance their robustness, generalizability, 
      and clinical applicability. By addressing these challenges, computer-aided 
      decision support systems could play a key role in the early detection of 
      Alzheimer's disease and potentially reduce health care costs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Individualized prediction of health outcomes supports clinical 
      medicine and decision making. Our primary objective was to offer a comprehensive 
      survey of methods for the dynamic prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      encompassing both conventional statistical methods and deep learning techniques. 
      METHODS: Articles were sourced from PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases 
      using keywords related to dynamic prediction of AD. A set of criteria was 
      developed to identify included studies. The correlation information for the 
      construction of models was extracted. RESULTS: We identified four methodological 
      frameworks for dynamic prediction from 18 studies with two-stage model (n = 3), 
      joint model (n = 11), landmark model (n = 2) and deep learning (n = 2). We 
      reported and summarized the specific construction of models and their 
      applications. CONCLUSIONS: Each framework possesses distinctive principles and 
      attendant benefits. The dynamic prediction models excel in predicting the 
      prognosis of individual patients in a real-time manner, surpassing the 
      limitations of traditional baseline-only prediction models. Future work should 
      consider various data types, complex longitudinal data, missing data, assumption 
      violations, survival outcomes, and interpretability of models.

TI  - Exploring the Value of MRI Measurement of Hippocampal Volume for Predicting the 
      Occurrence and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Artificial 
      Intelligence Deep Learning Technology and Evidence-Based Medicine Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 1275-1288

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a major dementia cause, lacks effective 
      treatment. MRI-based hippocampal volume measurement using artificial intelligence 
      offers new insights into early diagnosis and intervention in AD progression. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study, involving 483 AD patients, 756 patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI), and 968 normal controls (NC), investigated the 
      predictive capability of MRI-based hippocampus volume measurements for AD risk 
      using artificial intelligence and evidence-based medicine. METHODS: Utilizing 
      data from ADNI and OASIS-brains databases, three convolutional neural networks 
      (InceptionResNetv2, Densenet169, and SEResNet50) were employed for automated AD 
      classification based on structural MRI imaging. A multitask deep learning model 
      and a densely connected 3D convolutional network were utilized. Additionally, a 
      systematic meta-analysis explored the value of MRI-based hippocampal volume 
      measurement in predicting AD occurrence and progression, drawing on 23 eligible 
      articles from PubMed and Embase databases. RESULTS: InceptionResNetv2 
      outperformed other networks, achieving 99.75% accuracy and 100% AUC for AD-NC 
      classification and 99.16% accuracy and 100% AUC for MCI-NC classification. 
      Notably, at a 512×512 size, InceptionResNetv2 demonstrated a classification 
      accuracy of 94.29% and an AUC of 98% for AD-NC and 97.31% accuracy and 98% AUC 
      for MCI-NC. CONCLUSIONS: The study concludes that MRI-based hippocampal volume 
      changes effectively predict AD onset and progression, facilitating early 
      intervention and prevention.

AB  - Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by cognitive, affective, and motor dysfunction. The main 
      pathophysiological mechanisms are chronic neuroinflammation, hyper-phosphorylated 
      tau (p-tau) accumulation and neurodegeneration. CTE is mostly caused by exposure 
      to multiple mild traumatic brain injuries, placing people participating in, for 
      example, high contact sports at increased risk. Currently, CTE can solely be 
      diagnosed post mortem based on the spatial pattern of tau-accumulation. Herein, 
      we review candidate imaging and molecular biomarkers for their sensitivity and 
      specificity and we look whether these are sufficient for reliable ante mortem 
      diagnosis. Of the imaging biomarkers, PET appears to have the best potential. 
      Candidate fluid biomarkers consist of genes and proteins found in brain derived 
      extracellular vesicles, as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau levels. 
      However, neither these biomarkers nor the imaging biomarkers have the 
      discriminatory power to differentiate between CTE and other tauopathies, 
      highlighting the need for further validation. Future research could incorporate 
      machine learning methodologies to differentiate between the tau accumulation 
      patterns detected by PET/fMRI in Alzheimer's and CTE patients. Additionally, 
      proteomic and metabolomic profiling of CSF and plasma associated with chronic 
      mild traumatic brain injuries could highlight potential biomarkers for 
      identifying at risk patients.

      build-up of beta-amyloid plaques within the brain. The timely and precise 
      identification of beta-amyloid is essential for understanding disease progression 
      and developing effective therapeutic interventions. This comprehensive review 
      explores the diverse landscape of beta-amyloid detection methods, ranging from 
      traditional immunoassays to cutting-edge technologies. The review critically 
      examines the strengths and limitations of established techniques such as ELISA, 
      PET, and MRI, providing insights into their roles in research and clinical 
      settings. Emerging technologies, including electrochemical methods, 
      nanotechnology, fluorescence techniques, point-of-care devices, and machine 
      learning integration, are thoroughly discussed, emphasizing recent breakthroughs 
      and their potential for revolutionizing beta-amyloid detection. Furthermore, the 
      review delves into the challenges associated with current detection methods, such 
      as sensitivity, specificity, and accessibility. By amalgamating knowledge from 
      multidisciplinary approaches, this review aims to guide researchers, clinicians, 
      and policymakers in navigating the complex landscape of beta-amyloid detection, 
      ultimately contributing to advancements in Alzheimer's disease diagnostics and 
      therapeutics.

TI  - The application value of Rs-fMRI-based machine learning models for 
      differentiating mild cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 45-62
LID - 10.1007/s10072-024-07731-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various machine learning (ML) models based on resting-state 
      functional MRI (Rs-fMRI) have been developed to facilitate differential diagnosis 
      of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the 
      diagnostic accuracy of such models remains understudied. Therefore, we conducted 
      this systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the diagnostic accuracy of 
      Rs-fMRI-based radiomics in differentiating MCI from AD. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, 
      Cochrane, and Web of Science were searched from inception up to February 8, 2024, 
      to identify relevant studies. Meta-analysis was conducted using a bivariate 
      mixed-effects model, and sub-group analyses were carried out by the types of ML 
      tasks (binary classification and multi-class classification tasks). FINDINGS: In 
      total, 23 studies, comprising 5,554 participants were enrolled in the study. In 
      the binary classification tasks (twenty studies), the diagnostic accuracy of the 
      ML model for AD was 0.99 (95%CI: 0.34 ~ 1.00), with a sensitivity of 0.94 (95%CI: 
      0.89 ~ 0.97) and a specificity of 0.98 (95%CI: 0.95 ~ 1.00). In the multi-class 
      classification tasks (six studies), the diagnostic accuracy of the ML model was 
      0.98 (95%CI: 0.98 ~ 0.99) for NC, 0.96 (95%CI: 0.96 ~ 0.96) for early mild 
      cognitive impairment (EMCI), 0.97 (95%CI: 0.96 ~ 0.97) for late mild cognitive 
      impairment (LMCI), and 0.95 (95%CI: 0.95 ~ 0.95) for AD. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      Rs-fMRI-based ML model can be adapted to multi-class classification tasks. 
      Therefore, multi-center studies with large samples are needed to develop 
      intelligent application tools to promote the development of intelligent ML models 
      for disease diagnosis.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning to Arterial Spin Labeling in Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment and Alzheimer Disease.
PG  - 865-875
AB  - Purpose To investigate whether multivariate pattern recognition analysis of 
      arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion maps can be used for classification and 
      single-subject prediction of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) 
      after using the W score method to remove confounding effects of sex and age. 
      Materials and Methods Pseudocontinuous 3.0-T ASL images were acquired in 100 
      patients with probable AD; 60 patients with MCI, of whom 12 remained stable, 12 
      were converted to a diagnosis of AD, and 36 had no follow-up; 100 subjects with 
      SCD; and 26 healthy control subjects. The AD, MCI, and SCD groups were divided 
      into a sex- and age-matched training set (n = 130) and an independent prediction 
      set (n = 130). Standardized perfusion scores adjusted for age and sex (W scores) 
      were computed per voxel for each participant. Training of a support vector 
      machine classifier was performed with diagnostic status and perfusion maps. 
      Discrimination maps were extracted and used for single-subject classification in 
      the prediction set. Prediction performance was assessed with receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis to generate an area under the ROC curve (AUC) and 
      sensitivity and specificity distribution. Results Single-subject diagnosis in the 
      prediction set by using the discrimination maps yielded excellent performance for 
      AD versus SCD (AUC, 0.96; P < .01), good performance for AD versus MCI (AUC, 
      0.89; P < .01), and poor performance for MCI versus SCD (AUC, 0.63; P = .06). 
      Application of the AD versus SCD discrimination map for prediction of MCI 
      subgroups resulted in good performance for patients with MCI diagnosis converted 
      to AD versus subjects with SCD (AUC, 0.84; P < .01) and fair performance for 
      patients with MCI diagnosis converted to AD versus those with stable MCI (AUC, 
      0.71; P > .05). Conclusion With automated methods, age- and sex-adjusted ASL 
      perfusion maps can be used to classify and predict diagnosis of AD, conversion of 
      MCI to AD, stable MCI, and SCD with good to excellent accuracy and AUC values.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of computer science that focuses on 
      the development of machines that operate like humans. In the field of AI, medical 
      disease detection is an instantly growing domain of research. In the past years, 
      numerous endeavours have been made for the improvements of medical disease 
      detection, because the errors and problems in medical disease detection cause 
      serious wrong medical treatment. Meta-heuristic techniques have been frequently 
      utilized for the detection of medical diseases and promise better accuracy of 
      perception and prediction of diseases in the domain of biomedical. Particle Swarm 
      Optimization (PSO) is a swarm-based intelligent stochastic search technique 
      encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm during the searching of their 
      food source. Consequently, for the versatility of numerical experimentation, PSO 
      has been mostly applied to address the diverse kinds of optimization problems. 
      However, the PSO techniques are frequently adopted for the detection of diseases 
      but there is still a gap in the comparative survey. This paper presents an 
      insight into the diagnosis of medical diseases in health care using various PSO 
      approaches. This study presents to deliver a systematic literature review of 
      current PSO approaches for knowledge discovery in the field of disease detection. 
      The systematic analysis discloses the potential research areas of PSO strategies 
      as well as the research gaps, although, the main goal is to provide the 
      directions for future enhancement and development in this area. This paper gives 
      a systematic survey of this conceptual model for the advanced research, which has 
      been explored in the specified literature to date. This review comprehends the 
      fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and conventional application 
      fields. It is predicted that our study will be beneficial for the researchers to 
      review the PSO algorithms in-depth for disease detection. Several challenges that 
      can be undertaken to move the field forward are discussed according to the 
      current state of the PSO strategies in health care.

AB  - Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a formidable clinical 
      challenge, but emerging blood-based assays show promise for identifying at-risk 
      individuals long before cognitive symptoms arise. This is the first comprehensive 
      synthesis comparing mass-spectrometry and immunoassay platforms across multiple 
      blood-based AD biomarkers and the first to integrate these findings into a 
      unified roadmap for clinical implementation. In this review, we compare 
      high-throughput mass spectrometry and ultrasensitive immunoassays for quantifying 
      circulating amyloid-β isoforms, phosphorylated tau species (p-tau181, p-tau217), 
      neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), YKL-40 
      and selected inflammatory markers. Individual biomarkers demonstrate diagnostic 
      accuracies (AUC) up to 0.90, and integrating these protein signatures with APOE 
      ε4 genotype, brief cognitive assessments and neuroimaging via machine-learning 
      models boosts discrimination of preclinical AD from normal aging to over 80% 
      accuracy. We trace the path from initial discovery through analytical validation 
      to clinical implementation, emphasizing critical hurdles such as variability in 
      sample collection, limited cohort diversity and regulatory requirements. Future 
      work must standardize preanalytical protocols, extend validation across 
      populations, refine ultrasensitive detection techniques, and combine proteomic 
      data with genomics and other "omics" layers to move toward routine blood-based 
      screening. These coordinated efforts provide a clear roadmap for transforming 
      early AD diagnosis and enabling timely, personalized interventions.

AB  - Recent years have seen significant advances in diagnostic testing of central 
      nervous system (CNS) function and disease. However, there remain challenges in 
      developing a comprehensive suite of non- or minimally invasive assays of neural 
      health and disease progression. Due to the direct connection with the CNS, 
      structural changes in the neural retina, retinal vasculature and morphological 
      changes in retinal immune cells can occur in parallel with disease conditions in 
      the brain. The retina can also, uniquely, be assessed directly and 
      non-invasively. For these reasons, the retina may prove to be an important 
      "window" for revealing and understanding brain disease. In this review, we 
      discuss the gross anatomy of the eye, focusing on the sensory and non-sensory 
      cells of the retina, especially microglia, that lend themselves to diagnosing 
      brain disease by imaging the retina. We include a history of ocular imaging to 
      describe the different imaging approaches undertaken in the past and outline 
      current and emerging technologies including retinal autofluorescence imaging, 
      Raman spectroscopy, and artificial intelligence image analysis. These new 
      technologies show promising potential for retinal imaging to be used as a tool 
      for the diagnosis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and others and 
      the assessment of treatment success.

TI  - miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid associated with Alzheimer's disease: A systematic 
      review and pathway analysis using a data mining and machine learning approach.
PG  - 977-994
LID - 10.1111/jnc.16060 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type and accounts for 60%-70% of the 
      reported cases of dementia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that 
      play a crucial role in gene expression regulation. Although the diagnosis of AD 
      is primarily clinical, several miRNAs have been associated with AD and considered 
      as potential markers for diagnosis and progression of AD. We sought to match 
      AD-related miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) found in the GeoDataSets, 
      evaluated by machine learning, with miRNAs listed in a systematic review, and a 
      pathway analysis. Using machine learning approaches, we identified most 
      differentially expressed miRNAs in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), which were 
      validated by the systematic review, using the acronym PECO-Population (P): 
      Patients with AD, Exposure (E): expression of miRNAs, Comparison (C): Healthy 
      individuals, and Objective (O): miRNAs differentially expressed in CSF. 
      Additionally, pathway enrichment analysis was performed to identify the main 
      pathways involving at least four miRNAs selected. Four miRNAs were identified for 
      differentiating between patients with and without AD in machine learning combined 
      to systematic review, and followed the pathways analysis: miRNA-30a-3p, 
      miRNA-193a-5p, miRNA-143-3p, miRNA-145-5p. The pathways epidermal growth factor, 
      MAPK, TGF-beta and ATM-dependent DNA damage response, were regulated by these 
      miRNAs, but only the MAPK pathway presented higher relevance after a randomic 
      pathway analysis. These findings have the potential to assist in the development 
      of diagnostic tests for AD using miRNAs as biomarkers, as well as provide 
      understanding of the relationship between different pathophysiological mechanisms 
      of AD.

TI  - Image-based state-of-the-art techniques for the identification and classification 
      of brain diseases: a review.
PG  - 2603-2620
LID - 10.1007/s11517-020-02256-z [doi]
AB  - Detection and classification methods have a vital and important role in 
      identifying brain diseases. Timely detection and classification of brain diseases 
      enable an accurate identification and effective management of brain impairment. 
      Brain disorders are commonly most spreadable diseases and the diagnosing process 
      is time-consuming and highly expensive. There is an utmost need to develop 
      effective and advantageous methods for brain diseases detection and 
      characterization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and 
      other various brain imaging scans are used to identify different brain diseases 
      and disorders. Brain imaging scans are the efficient tool to understand the 
      anatomical changes in brain in fast and accurate manner. These different brain 
      imaging scans used with segmentation techniques and along with machine learning 
      and deep learning techniques give maximum accuracy and efficiency. This paper 
      focuses on different conventional approaches, machine learning and deep learning 
      techniques used for the detection, and classification of brain diseases and 
      abnormalities. This paper also summarizes the research gap and problems in the 
      existing techniques used for detection and classification of brain disorders. 
      Comparison and evaluation of different machine learning and deep learning 
      techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy are also highlighted in this 
      paper. Furthermore, different brain diseases like leukoariaosis, Alzheimer's, 
      Parkinson's, and Wilson's disorder are studied in the scope of machine learning 
      and deep learning techniques.

AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by a gradual but irreversible loss 
      of neurological function. The ability to detect and treat these conditions 
      successfully is crucial for ensuring the best possible quality of life for people 
      who suffer from them. The development of effective new methods for managing and 
      treating neurodegenerative illnesses has been made possible by recent 
      developments in computer technology. In this overview, we take a look at the 
      prospects for applying computational approaches, such as drug design, AI, ML, and 
      DL, to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. To review the current state 
      of the field, this article discusses the potential of computational methods for 
      early disease detection, quantifying disease progression, and understanding the 
      underlying biological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, as well as the 
      challenges associated with these approaches and potential future directions. 
      Moreover, it delves into the creation of computational models for the 
      individualization of care for neurodegenerative diseases. The article concludes 
      with suggestions for future studies and clinical applications, highlighting the 
      advantages and disadvantages of using computational techniques in the treatment 
      of neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - As the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, the search for a 
      definitive, easy to access diagnostic biomarker has become increasingly 
      important. Micro RNA (miRNA), involved in the epigenetic regulation of protein 
      synthesis, is a biological mark which varies in association with a number of 
      disease states, possibly including AD. Here we comprehensively review methods and 
      findings from 26 studies comparing the measurement of miRNA in blood between AD 
      cases and controls. Thirteen of these studies used receiver operator 
      characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine the diagnostic accuracy of identified 
      miRNA to predict AD, and three studies did this with a machine learning approach. 
      Of 8098 individually measured miRNAs, 23 that were differentially expressed 
      between AD cases and controls were found to be significant in two or more 
      studies. Only six of these were consistent in their direction of expression 
      between studies (miR-107, miR-125b, miR-146a, miR-181c, miR-29b, and miR-342), 
      and they were all shown to be down regulated in individuals with AD compared to 
      controls. Of these directionally concordant miRNAs, the strongest evidence was 
      for miR-107 which has also been shown in previous studies to be involved in the 
      dysregulation of proteins involved in aspects of AD pathology, as well as being 
      consistently downregulated in studies of AD brains. We conclude that imperative 
      to the discovery of reliable and replicable miRNA biomarkers of AD, standardised 
      methods of measurements, appropriate statistical analysis, utilization of large 
      datasets with machine learning approaches, and comprehensive reporting of 
      findings is urgently needed.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the prevalent neurodegenerative disorder 
      characterized by the accumulation of aberrant proteins that obstruct brain cells 
      and neurons. Early detection of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers is very 
      critical for effective treatment of AD. However, the current probes for early 
      clinical diagnosis of AD are invasive and costly, susceptible to interference by 
      biological background fluorescence, and lack sufficient penetration capabilities 
      and challenges associated with imaging in vivo. Therefore, it is very important 
      to develop small-molecular fluorescent probes with biocompatibility, strong 
      penetration ability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), customizable physical and 
      chemical properties, and real-time non-destructive in situ monitoring. This 
      review provides a comprehensive overview of protein aggregates, reactive oxygen 
      species, metal ions, gas markers, cholinesterase, cysteine, and other recently 
      discovered biomarkers, concentrating on the mechanism of targeted diagnosis and 
      the relationship between probe structure and characteristics. In addition, the 
      review also summaries recent advances in machine learning and artificial 
      intelligence for AD field. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects of 
      small-molecule fluorescent probes for AD diagnosis and clinical application are 
      also summarized. This review aims to provide a foundation for researchers in this 
      field, stimulate innovative molecular design strategies, expedite the clinical 
      evaluation of AD probes, and ultimately achieving accurate early detection of AD.

      Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence: Literature Review.
PG  - e62914
LID - 10.2196/62914 [doi]
LID - e62914
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review explores the potential of virtual reality (VR) and 
      artificial intelligence (AI) to identify preclinical cognitive markers of 
      Alzheimer disease (AD). By synthesizing recent studies, it aims to advance early 
      diagnostic methods to detect AD before significant symptoms occur. OBJECTIVE: 
      Research emphasizes the significance of early detection in AD during the 
      preclinical phase, which does not involve cognitive impairment but nevertheless 
      requires reliable biomarkers. Current biomarkers face challenges, prompting the 
      exploration of cognitive behavior indicators beyond episodic memory. METHODS: 
      Using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 
      guidelines, we searched Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies on 
      neuropsychiatric disorders utilizing conversational data. RESULTS: Following an 
      analysis of 38 selected articles, we highlight verbal episodic memory as a 
      sensitive preclinical AD marker, with supporting evidence from neuroimaging and 
      genetic profiling. Executive functions precede memory decline, while processing 
      speed is a significant correlate. The potential of VR remains underexplored, and 
      AI algorithms offer a multidimensional approach to early neurocognitive disorder 
      diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging technologies like VR and AI show promise for 
      preclinical diagnostics, but thorough validation and regulation for clinical 
      safety and efficacy are necessary. Continued technological advancements are 
      expected to enhance early detection and management of AD.

AB  - Neurogenetic disorders (NeD) are a group of neurological conditions resulting 
      from inherited genetic defects. By affecting the normal functioning of the 
      nervous system, these diseases lead to serious problems in movement, cognition, 
      and other body functions. In recent years, machine learning (ML) approaches have 
      proven highly effective, enabling the analysis and processing of vast amounts of 
      medical data. By analyzing genetic data, medical imaging, and other clinical 
      data, these techniques can contribute to early diagnosis and more effective 
      treatment of NeD. However, using these approaches is challenged by issues 
      including data variability, model explainability, and the requirement for 
      interdisciplinary collaboration. This paper investigates the impact of ML on 
      healthcare diagnosis and care of common NeD, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Multiple Sclerosis 
      disease (MSD). The purpose of this research is to determine the opportunities and 
      challenges of using these techniques in the field of neurogenetic medicine. Our 
      findings show that using ML can increase the detection accuracy by 85 % and 
      reduce the detection time by 60 %. Additionally, the use of these techniques in 
      predicting patient prognosis has been 70 % more accurate than traditional 
      methods. Ultimately, this research will enable medical professionals and 
      researchers to leverage ML approaches in advancing the diagnostic and therapeutic 
      processes of NeD by identifying the opportunities and challenges.

AB  - The detection and segmentation of stained cells and nuclei are essential 
      prerequisites for subsequent quantitative research for many diseases. Recently, 
      deep learning has shown strong performance in many computer vision problems, 
      including solutions for medical image analysis. Furthermore, accurate 
      stereological quantification of microscopic structures in stained tissue sections 
      plays a critical role in understanding human diseases and developing safe and 
      effective treatments. In this article, we review the most recent deep learning 
      approaches for cell (nuclei) detection and segmentation in cancer and Alzheimer's 
      disease with an emphasis on deep learning approaches combined with unbiased 
      stereology. Major challenges include accurate and reproducible cell detection and 
      segmentation of microscopic images from stained sections. Finally, we discuss 
      potential improvements and future trends in deep learning applied to cell 
      detection and segmentation.

      Follow-Up Study.
PG  - 1647-1657

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accurately predicting whether and when mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI) will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of vital importance to help 
      developing individualized treatment plans to defer the occurrence of irreversible 
      dementia. PURPOSE: To develop and validate radiomics models and multipredictor 
      nomogram for predicting the time to progression (TTP) from MCI to AD. STUDY TYPE: 
      Retrospective. POPULATION: One hundred sixty-two MCI patients (96 men and 66 
      women [median age, 72; age range, 56-88 years]) were included from the 
      Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. FIELD 
      STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: T(1) -weighted imaging and T(2) -weighted fluid-attenuation 
      inversion recovery imaging acquired at 3.0 T. ASSESSMENT: During the 5-year 
      follow-up, 68 patients converted to AD and 94 remained stable. Patients were 
      randomly divided into the training (n = 112) and validation datasets (n = 50). 
      Radiomic features were extracted from the whole cerebral cortex and subcortical 
      nucleus of MR images. A radiomics model was established using least absolute 
      shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression. The clinical-laboratory 
      model and radiomics-clinical-laboratory model were developed by multivariate Cox 
      proportional hazard model. The performance of each model was assessed by the 
      concordance index (C-index). A multipredictor nomogram derived from the 
      radiomics-clinical-laboratory model was constructed for individualized TTP 
      estimation. STATISTICAL TESTS: LASSO cox regression, univariate and multivariate 
      Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier analysis and Student's t test were performed. 
      RESULTS: The C-index of the radiomics, clinical-laboratory and 
      radiomics-clinical-laboratory models were 0.924 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      0.894-0.952), 0.903 (0.868-0.938), 0.950 (0.929-0.971) in the training cohort and 
      0.811 (0.707-0.914), 0.901 (0824-0.977), 0.907 (0.836-0.979) in the validation 
      cohort, respectively. A multipredictor nomogram with 15 predictors was 
      established, which had high accuracy for individual TTP prediction with the 
      C-index of 0.950 (0.929-0.971). DATA CONCLUSION: The prediction of individual TTP 
      from MCI to AD could be accurately conducted using the 
      radiomics-clinical-laboratory model and multipredictor nomogram. EVIDENCE LEVEL:

TI  - Prediction of differentially expressed microRNAs in blood as potential biomarkers 
      for Alzheimer's disease by meta-analysis and adaptive boosting ensemble learning.
PG  - 126

AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood circulating microRNAs that are specific for Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) can be identified from differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRNAs). 
      However, non-reproducible and inconsistent reports of DEmiRNAs hinder biomarker 
      development. The most reliable DEmiRNAs can be identified by meta-analysis. To 
      enrich the pool of DEmiRNAs for potential AD biomarkers, we used a machine 
      learning method called adaptive boosting for miRNA disease association (ABMDA) to 
      identify eligible candidates that share similar characteristics with the DEmiRNAs 
      identified from meta-analysis. This study aimed to identify blood circulating 
      DEmiRNAs as potential AD biomarkers by augmenting meta-analysis with the ABMDA 
      ensemble learning method. METHODS: Studies on DEmiRNAs and their 
      dysregulation states were corroborated with one another by meta-analysis based on 
      a random-effects model. DEmiRNAs identified by meta-analysis were collected as 
      positive examples of miRNA-AD pairs for ABMDA ensemble learning. ABMDA identified 
      similar DEmiRNAs according to a set of predefined criteria. The biological 
      significance of all resulting DEmiRNAs was determined by their target genes 
      according to pathway enrichment analyses. The target genes common to both 
      meta-analysis- and ABMDA-identified DEmiRNAs were collected to construct a 
      network to investigate their biological functions. RESULTS: A systematic database 
      search found 7841 studies for an extensive meta-analysis, covering 54 independent 
      comparisons of 47 differential miRNA expression studies, and identified 18 
      reliable DEmiRNAs. ABMDA ensemble learning was conducted based on the 
      meta-analysis results and the Human MicroRNA Disease Database, which identified 
      10 additional AD-related DEmiRNAs. These 28 DEmiRNAs and their dysregulated 
      pathways were related to neuroinflammation. The dysregulated pathway related to 
      neuronal cell cycle re-entry (CCR) was the only statistically significant pathway 
      of the ABMDA-identified DEmiRNAs. In the biological network constructed from 1865 
      common target genes of the identified DEmiRNAs, the multiple core 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system, that is involved in neuroinflammation and CCR, was 
      highly connected. CONCLUSION: This study identified 28 DEmiRNAs as potential AD 
      biomarkers in blood, by meta-analysis and ABMDA ensemble learning in tandem. The 
      DEmiRNAs identified by meta-analysis and ABMDA were significantly related to 
      neuroinflammation, and the ABMDA-identified DEmiRNAs were related to neuronal 
      CCR.

AB  - Brain aging is associated with a decline in cognitive performance, motor function 
      and sensory perception, even in the absence of neurodegeneration. The underlying 
      pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely understood, though alterations 
      in neurogenesis, neuronal senescence and synaptic plasticity are implicated. 
      Recent years have seen advancements in neurophysiological techniques such as 
      electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), event-related 
      potentials (ERP) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), offering insights 
      into physiological and pathological brain aging. These methods provide real-time 
      information on brain activity, connectivity and network dynamics. Integration of 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques promise as a tool enhancing the diagnosis 
      and prognosis of age-related cognitive decline. Our review highlights recent 
      advances in these electrophysiological techniques (focusing on EEG, ERP, TMS and 
      TMS-EEG methodologies) and their application in physiological and pathological 
      brain aging. Physiological aging is characterized by changes in EEG spectral 
      power and connectivity, ERP and TMS parameters, indicating alterations in neural 
      activity and network function. Pathological aging, such as in Alzheimer's 
      disease, is associated with further disruptions in EEG rhythms, ERP components 
      and TMS measures, reflecting underlying neurodegenerative processes. Machine 
      learning approaches show promise in classifying cognitive impairment and 
      predicting disease progression. Standardization of neurophysiological methods and 
      integration with other modalities are crucial for a comprehensive understanding 
      of brain aging and neurodegenerative disorders. Advanced network analysis 
      techniques and AI methods hold potential for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and 
      deepening insights into age-related brain changes.

AB  - Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an ever-growing field of computational 
      science that aims to model natural human language. Combined with advances in 
      machine learning, which learns patterns in data, it offers practical capabilities 
      including automated language analysis. These approaches have garnered interest 
      from clinical researchers seeking to understand the breakdown of language due to 
      pathological changes in the brain, offering fast, replicable and objective 
      methods. The study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and preclinical Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment (MCI), suggests that changes in discourse (connected speech or 
      writing) may be key to early detection of disease. There is currently no 
      disease-modifying treatment for AD, the leading cause of dementia in people over 
      the age of 65, but detection of those at risk of developing the disease could 
      help with the identification and testing of medications which can take effect 
      before the underlying pathology has irreversibly spread. We outline important 
      components of natural language, as well as NLP tools and approaches with which 
      they can be extracted, analysed and used for disease identification and risk 
      prediction. We review literature using these tools to model discourse across the 
      spectrum of AD, including the contribution of machine learning approaches and 
      Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We conclude that NLP and machine learning 
      techniques are starting to greatly enhance research in the field, with measurable 
      and quantifiable language components showing promise for early detection of 
      disease, but there remain research and practical challenges for clinical 
      implementation of these approaches. Challenges discussed include the availability 
      of large and diverse datasets, ethics of data collection and sharing, diagnostic 
      specificity and clinical acceptability.

PG  - 5117-5127
LID - 10.1007/s10072-024-07649-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this narrative review are to summarize the current 
      state of AI applications in neuroimaging for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      prediction and to highlight the potential of AI techniques in improving early AD 
      diagnosis, prognosis, and management. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of 
      studies using AI techniques applied to neuroimaging data for early AD prediction. 
      We examined single-modality studies using structural MRI and PET imaging, as well 
      as multi-modality studies integrating multiple neuroimaging techniques and 
      biomarkers. Furthermore, they reviewed longitudinal studies that model AD 
      progression and identify individuals at risk of rapid decline. RESULTS: 
      Single-modality studies using structural MRI and PET imaging have demonstrated 
      high accuracy in classifying AD and predicting progression from mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) to AD. Multi-modality studies, integrating multiple neuroimaging 
      techniques and biomarkers, have shown improved performance and robustness 
      compared to single-modality approaches. Longitudinal studies have highlighted the 
      value of AI in modeling AD progression and identifying individuals at risk of 
      rapid decline. However, challenges remain in data standardization, model 
      interpretability, generalizability, clinical integration, and ethical 
      considerations. CONCLUSION: AI techniques applied to neuroimaging data have the 
      potential to improve early AD diagnosis, prognosis, and management. Addressing 
      challenges related to data standardization, model interpretability, 
      generalizability, clinical integration, and ethical considerations is crucial for 
      realizing the full potential of AI in AD research and clinical practice. 
      Collaborative efforts among researchers, clinicians, and regulatory agencies are 
      needed to develop reliable, robust, and ethical AI tools that can benefit AD 
      patients and society.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents significant challenges in drug discovery and 
      development due to its complex and poorly understood pathology and etiology. 
      Digital twins (DTs) are recently developed virtual real-time representations of 
      physical entities that enable rapid assessment of the bidirectional interaction 
      between the virtual and physical domains. With recent advances in artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and the growing accumulation of multi-omics and clinical data, 
      application of DTs in healthcare is gaining traction. Digital twin technology, in 
      the form of multiscale virtual models of patients or organ systems, can track 
      health status in real time with continuous feedback, thereby driving model 
      updates that enhance clinical decision-making. Here, we posit an additional role 
      for DTs in drug discovery, with particular utility for complex diseases like AD. 
      In this review, we discuss salient challenges in AD drug development, including 
      complex disease pathology and comorbidities, difficulty in early diagnosis, and 
      the current high failure rate of clinical trials. We also review DTs and discuss 
      potential applications for predicting AD progression, discovering biomarkers, 
      identifying new drug targets and opportunities for drug repurposing, facilitating 
      clinical trials, and advancing precision medicine. Despite significant hurdles in 
      this area, such as integration and standardization of dynamic medical data and 
      issues of data security and privacy, DTs represent a promising approach for 
      revolutionizing drug discovery in AD.

LID - 5252
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative technology in 
      managing Alzheimer's Disease (AD), offering novel solutions for early diagnosis, 
      continuous patient monitoring, and assistive care. This review presents a 
      comprehensive analysis of IoT-enabled systems tailored to AD care, focusing on 
      wearable biosensors, cognitive monitoring tools, smart home automation, and 
      Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven analytics. A systematic literature survey was 
      conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify, screen, and synthesize 236 
      relevant studies primarily published between 2020 and 2025 across IEEE Xplore, 
      PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed 
      articles that proposed or evaluated IoT-based solutions for AD detection, 
      progression monitoring, or patient assistance. Key findings highlight the 
      effectiveness of the IoT in detecting behavioral and cognitive changes, enhancing 
      safety through real-time alerts, and improving patient autonomy. The review also 
      explores integration challenges such as data privacy, system interoperability, 
      and clinical adoption. The study reveals critical gaps in real-world deployment, 
      clinical validation, and ethical integration of IoT-based systems for Alzheimer's 
      care. This study aims to serve as a definitive reference for researchers, 
      clinicians, and developers working at the intersection of the IoT and 
      neurodegenerative healthcare.

      assessment. PET/CT, particularly with 2-deoxy-2-[fluorine-18]fluoro-D-glucose 
      (18F-FDG), facilitates the visualization of glucose metabolism in the brain, 
      enabling early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of neurodegenerative disease 
      progression. The advent of amyloid and tau PET imaging has further propelled the 
      field forward, offering invaluable tools for tracking pathological hallmarks, 
      assessing treatment response, and predicting clinical outcomes. While some 
      therapeutic interventions targeting amyloid plaque load showed promising results 
      with the reduction of cerebral amyloid accumulation over time, others failed to 
      demonstrate a significant impact of anti-amyloid agents for reducing the amyloid 
      plaques burden in AD brains. Tau PET imaging has conversely fueled the advent of 
      disease-modifying therapeutic strategies in AD by supporting the assessment of 
      neurofibrillary tangles of tau pathology deposition over time. Looking ahead, PET 
      imaging holds immense promise for studying additional targets such as 
      neuroinflammation, cholinergic deficit, and synaptic dysfunction. Advances in 
      radiotracer development, dedicated brain PET/CT scanners, and Artificial 
      Intelligence-powered software are poised to enhance the quality, sensitivity, and 
      diagnostic power of molecular neuroimaging. Consequently, PET/CT remains at the 
      forefront of AD research, offering unparalleled opportunities for unravelling the 
      complexities of the disease and advancing therapeutic interventions, although it 
      is not yet enough alone to allow patients' recruitment in therapeutic clinical 
      trials.

AB  - Radiomics allows extraction from medical images of quantitative features that are 
      able to reveal tissue patterns that are generally invisible to human observers. 
      Despite the challenges in visually interpreting radiomic features and the 
      computational resources required to generate them, they hold significant value in 
      downstream automated processing. For instance, in statistical or machine learning 
      frameworks, radiomic features enhance sensitivity and specificity, making them 
      indispensable for tasks such as diagnosis, prognosis, prediction, monitoring, 
      image-guided interventions, and evaluating therapeutic responses. This review 
      explores the application of radiomics in neurodegenerative diseases, with a focus 
      on Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple 
      sclerosis. While radiomics literature often focuses on magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), this review also covers its broader 
      application in nuclear medicine, with use cases of positron emission tomography 
      (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radiomics. 
      Additionally, we review integrated radiomics, where features from multiple 
      imaging modalities are fused to improve model performance. This review also 
      highlights the growing integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence and 
      the need for feature standardisation and reproducibility to facilitate its 
      translation into clinical practice.

AB  - Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) represent a health emergency. The 
      identification of valid and noninvasive markers to identify people with Mild 
      Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is profoundly advocated. This review outlines the use 
      of quantitative Motor and Cognitive Dual-Task (MCDT) on MCI, by technologies aid. 
      We describe the framework and the most valuable researches, displaying the 
      adopted protocols, and the available technologies. PubMed Central, Web of 
      Science, and Scopus were inspected between January 2010 and May 2020. 1939 
      articles were found in the initial quest. Exclusion criteria allowed the 
      selection of the most relevant papers; 38 papers were included. The articles, 
      regarding four technological solutions "wearable sensors", "personal devices", 
      "optokinetic systems", and "electronic walkways", are organized into three 
      categories: "Quantitative MCDT", "MCDT Inspired by Neuropsychological Test", and 
      "MCDT for MCI Stimulation". MCDT might furnish clinical landmarks, supplying aid 
      for disease stratication, risk prediction, and intervention optimization. Such 
      protocols could foster the use of data mining and machine learning techniques. 
      Notwithstanding, there is still a need to standardize and harmonize such 
      protocols.

PG  - 793-823
LID - 10.3233/JAD-231271 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The growing number of older adults in recent decades has led to more 
      prevalent geriatric diseases, such as strokes and dementia. Therefore, 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), as the most common type of dementia, has become more 
      frequent too. BACKGROUND: Objective: The goals of this work are to present 
      state-of-the-art studies focused on the automatic diagnosis and prognosis of AD 
      and its early stages, mainly mild cognitive impairment, and predicting how the 
      research on this topic may change in the future. METHODS: Articles found in the 
      existing literature needed to fulfill several selection criteria. Among others, 
      their classification methods were based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), 
      including deep learning, and data not from brain signals or neuroimaging 
      techniques were used. Considering our selection criteria, 42 articles published 
      in the last decade were finally selected. RESULTS: The most medically significant 
      results are shown. Similar quantities of articles based on shallow and deep ANNs 
      were found. Recurrent neural networks and transformers were common with speech or 
      in longitudinal studies. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were popular with 
      gait or combined with others in modular approaches. Above one third of the 
      cross-sectional studies utilized multimodal data. Non-public datasets were 
      frequently used in cross-sectional studies, whereas the opposite in longitudinal 
      ones. The most popular databases were indicated, which will be helpful for future 
      researchers in this field. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of CNNs in the last 
      decade and their superb results with neuroimaging data did not negatively affect 
      the usage of other modalities. In fact, new ones emerged.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to quantify the identification of mild cognitive impairment 
      and/or Alzheimer's disease using olfactory-stimulated functional near-infrared 
      spectroscopy using machine learning through a post hoc analysis of a previous 
      diagnostic trial and an external additional trial. METHODS: We conducted two 
      independent, patient-level, single-group, diagnostic interventional trials 
      (original and additional trials) involving elderly volunteers (aged > 60 years) 
      with suspected declining cognitive function. All volunteers were assessed by 
      measuring the oxygenation difference in the orbitofrontal cortex using an 
      open-label olfactory-stimulated functional near-infrared spectroscopy approach, 
      medical interview, amyloid positron emission tomography, brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Seoul Neuropsychological Screening 
      Battery. RESULTS: In total, 97 (original trial) and 36 (additional trial) elderly 
      volunteers with suspected decline in cognitive function met the eligibility 
      criteria. The statistical model reported classification accuracies of 87.3% in 
      patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in internal 
      validation (original trial) but 63.9% in external validation (additional trial). 
      The machine learning algorithm achieved 92.5% accuracy with the internal 
      validation data and 82.5% accuracy with the external validation data. For the 
      diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, machine learning performed better than 
      statistical methods with internal (86.0% versus 85.2%) and external validation 
      data (85.4% versus 68.8%). INTERPRETATION: In two independent trials, machine 
      learning models using olfactory-stimulated oxygenation differences in the 
      orbitofrontal cortex were superior in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment and 
      Alzheimer's disease compared to classic statistical models. Our results suggest 
      that the machine learning algorithm is stable across different patient groups and 
      increases generalization and reproducibility. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical

TI  - Frontiers for the Early Diagnosis of AD by Means of MRI Brain Imaging and Support 
      Vector Machines.
PG  - 509-33
AB  - The emergence of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as a consequence of increasing aging 
      population makes urgent the availability of methods for the early and accurate 
      diagnosis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) could be used as in vivo, non 
      invasive tool to identify sensitive and specific markers of very early AD 
      progression. In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and machine- 
      learning algorithms have attracted strong interest within the neuroimaging 
      community, as they allow automatic classification of imaging data with higher 
      performance than univariate statistical analysis. An exhaustive search of PubMed, 
      Web of Science and Medline records was performed in this work, in order to 
      retrieve studies focused on the potential role of MRI in aiding the clinician in 
      early diagnosis of AD by using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as MVPA automated 
      classification method. A total of 30 studies emerged, published from 2008 to 
      date. This review aims to give a state-of-the-art overview about SVM for the 
      early and differential diagnosis of AD-related pathologies by means of MRI data, 
      starting from preliminary steps such as image pre-processing, feature extraction 
      and feature selection, and ending with classification, validation strategies and 
      extraction of MRI-related biomarkers. The main advantages and drawbacks of the 
      different techniques were explored. Results obtained by the reviewed studies were 
      reported in terms of classification performance and biomarker outcomes, in order 
      to shed light on the parameters that accompany normal and pathological aging. 
      Unresolved issues and possible future directions were finally pointed out.

TI  - Predictive models of Alzheimer's disease dementia risk in older adults with mild 
      cognitive impairment: a systematic review and critical appraisal.
PG  - 531

LID - 531
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment has received widespread attention as a 
      high-risk population for Alzheimer's disease, and many studies have developed or 
      validated predictive models to assess it. However, the performance of the model 
      development remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to 
      provide an overview of prediction models for the risk of Alzheimer's disease 
      dementia in older adults with mild cognitive impairment. METHOD: PubMed, EMBASE, 
      Web of Science, and MEDLINE were systematically searched up to October 19, 2023. 
      We included cohort studies in which risk prediction models for Alzheimer's 
      disease dementia in older adults with mild cognitive impairment were developed or 
      validated. The Predictive Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was 
      employed to assess model bias and applicability. Random-effects models combined 
      model AUCs and calculated (approximate) 95% prediction intervals for estimations. 
      Heterogeneity across studies was evaluated using the I(2) statistic, and subgroup 
      analyses were conducted to investigate sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, 
      funnel plot analysis was utilized to identify publication bias. RESULTS: The 
      analysis included 16 studies involving 9290 participants. Frequency analysis of 
      predictors showed that 14 appeared at least twice and more, with age, functional 
      activities questionnaire, and Mini-mental State Examination scores of cognitive 
      functioning being the most common predictors. From the studies, only two models 
      were externally validated. Eleven studies ultimately used machine learning, and 
      four used traditional modelling methods. However, we found that in many of the 
      studies, there were problems with insufficient sample sizes, missing important 
      methodological information, lack of model presentation, and all of the models 
      were rated as having a high or unclear risk of bias. The average AUC of the 15 
      best-developed predictive models was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83, 0.90). DISCUSSION: Most 
      published predictive modelling studies are deficient in rigour, resulting in a 
      high risk of bias. Upcoming research should concentrate on enhancing 
      methodological rigour and conducting external validation of models predicting 
      Alzheimer's disease dementia. We also emphasize the importance of following the 
      scientific method and transparent reporting to improve the accuracy, 
      generalizability and reproducibility of study results. REGISTRATION: This 
      systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD42023468780).

AB  - In the context of dementia care, Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered clinical 
      decision support systems have the potential to enhance diagnosis and management. 
      However, the scope and challenges of applying these technologies remain unclear. 
      This scoping review aims to investigate the current state of AI applications in 
      the development of intelligent decision support systems for dementia care. We 
      conducted a comprehensive scoping review of empirical studies that utilised 
      AI-powered clinical decision support systems in dementia care. The results 
      indicate that AI applications in dementia care primarily focus on diagnosis, with 
      limited attention to other aspects outlined in the World Health Organization 
      (WHO) Global Action Plan on the Public Health Response to Dementia 2017-2025 
      (GAPD). A trifecta of challenges, encompassing data availability, cost 
      considerations, and AI algorithm performance, emerges as noteworthy barriers in 
      adoption of AI applications in dementia care. To address these challenges and 
      enhance AI reliability, we propose a novel approach: a digital twin-based patient 
      journey model. Future research should address identified gaps in GAPD action 
      areas, navigate data-related obstacles, and explore the implementation of digital 
      twins. Additionally, it is imperative to emphasize that addressing trust and 
      combating the stigma associated with AI in healthcare should be a central focus 
      of future research directions.

AB  - Protein misfolding and aggregation play a central role in the progression of 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. These aggregates 
      manifest either as structured amyloid fibrils enriched in β-sheet conformations 
      or as irregular amorphous aggregates with diverse morphologies. Understanding 
      their formation, structure, and behavior is critical for deciphering disease 
      mechanisms and developing targeted diagnostics and therapeutics. This review 
      presents an integrated overview of both conventional and advanced techniques used 
      to detect, distinguish, and structurally characterize these protein aggregates. 
      It covers a range of spectroscopic and spectrometric tools, such as fluorescence, 
      Raman, and mass spectrometry that facilitate aggregate identification. Microscopy 
      methods, including atomic force and electron microscopy, are highlighted for 
      morphological analysis. The review also discusses in situ detection strategies 
      using fluorescent dyes, conformation-specific antibodies, enzymatic reporters, 
      and real-time imaging. Separation methods like centrifugation, electrophoresis, 
      and chromatography are outlined alongside structural analysis tools such as X-ray 
      diffraction. Furthermore, the growing utility of computational approaches and 
      artificial intelligence in predicting aggregation propensities and integrating 
      biological data is emphasized. By critically evaluating each method's 
      capabilities and limitations, this review provides a practical and 
      forward-looking resource for researchers studying the complex landscape of 
      protein aggregation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the complex and progressive nature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      a precision medicine approach for diagnosis and treatment requires the 
      identification of patient subgroups with biomedically distinct and actionable 
      phenotype definitions. METHODS: Longitudinal patient-level data for 1160 AD 
      patients receiving placebo or no treatment with a follow-up of up to 18 months 
      were extracted from an integrated clinical trials dataset. We used latent class 
      mixed modelling (LCMM) to identify patient subgroups demonstrating distinct 
      patterns of change over time in disease severity, as measured by the Alzheimer's 
      Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score. The optimal number of 
      subgroups (classes) was selected by the model which had the lowest Bayesian 
      Information Criterion. Other patient-level variables were used to define these 
      subgroups' distinguishing characteristics and to investigate the interactions 
      between patient characteristics and patterns of disease progression. RESULTS: The 
      LCMM resulted in three distinct subgroups of patients, with 10.3% in Class 1, 
      76.5% in Class 2 and 13.2% in Class 3. While all classes demonstrated some degree 
      of cognitive decline, each demonstrated a different pattern of change in 
      cognitive scores, potentially reflecting different subtypes of AD patients. Class 
      1 represents rapid decliners with a steep decline in cognition over time, and who 
      tended to be younger and better educated. Class 2 represents slow decliners, 
      while Class 3 represents severely impaired slow decliners: patients with a 
      similar rate of decline to Class 2 but with worse baseline cognitive scores. 
      Class 2 demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history 
      of statins use; Class 3 showed lower levels of blood monocytes and serum calcium, 
      and higher blood glucose levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results, 'learned' from 
      clinical data, indicate the existence of at least three subgroups of Alzheimer's 
      patients, each demonstrating a different trajectory of disease progression. This 
      hypothesis-generating approach has detected distinct AD subgroups that may prove 
      to be discrete endophenotypes linked to specific aetiologies. These findings 
      could enable stratification within a clinical trial or study context, which may 
      help identify new targets for intervention and guide better care.

TI  - Forty years of structural brain imaging in mental disorders: is it clinically 
      useful or not?
PG  - 179-186
AB  - Structural brain imaging was introduced into routine clinical practice more than 
      40 years ago with the hope that it would support the diagnosis and treatment of 
      mental disorders. It is now widely used to exclude organic brain disease (eg, 
      brain tumors, cardiovascular, and inflammatory processes) in mental disorders. 
      However, questions have been raised about whether structural brain imaging is 
      still needed today and whether it could also be clinically useful to apply new 
      biostatistical methods, such as machine learning. Therefore, the current paper 
      not only reviews structural findings in Alzheimer disease, depression, bipolar 
      disorder, and schizophrenia but also discusses the role of structural imaging in 
      supporting diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic processes in mental disorders. 
      Thus, it attempts to answer the questions whether, after four decades of use, 
      structural brain imaging is clinically useful in mental disorders or whether it 
      will become so in the future.

TI  - Large language models for Alzheimer's disease drug discovery.
PG  - 799-822
LID - 10.1177/13872877251346890 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with significant 
      global health and economic impacts. Despite decades of research, therapeutic 
      progress has been hindered by the multifactorial nature of AD and limitations in 
      traditional drug discovery approaches. This review explores the transformative 
      potential of large language models (LLMs) in advancing medicinal chemistry for AD 
      drug discovery. LLMs excel at processing and synthesizing vast biomedical 
      datasets, enabling breakthroughs in hypothesis generation, target identification, 
      and de novo drug design. By integrating multi-modal data, these models address 
      key challenges, including patient heterogeneity, inefficiencies in preclinical 
      models, and high failure rates in clinical trials. This paper highlights case 
      studies and current implementations, including their roles in literature mining, 
      protein structure prediction, and absorption, distribution, metabolism, 
      excretion, and toxicity (ADME-Tox) property assessment, showcasing LLMs' capacity 
      to enhance drug discovery efficiency and precision. Despite challenges related to 
      data quality, interpretability, and ethical concerns, LLMs offer a promising 
      paradigm shift in AD research, paving the way for innovative therapeutic 
      solutions and interdisciplinary collaboration. This review serves as a resource 
      for fostering artificial intelligence-biomedicine integration to combat AD and 
      improve patient outcomes.

TI  - Update on the Use of Pulse Wave Velocity to Measure Age-Related Vascular Changes.
PG  - 131-140
LID - 10.1007/s11906-023-01285-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is an important and well-established 
      measure of arterial stiffness that is strongly associated with aging. Age-related 
      alterations in the elastic properties and integrity of arterial walls can lead to 
      cardiovascular disease. PWV measurements play an important role in the 
      early detection of these changes, as well as other cardiovascular disease risk 
      factors, such as hypertension. This review provides a comprehensive summary of 
      the current knowledge of the effects of aging on arterial stiffness, as measured 
      by PWV. RECENT FINDINGS: This review highlights recent findings showing the 
      applicability of PWV analysis for investigating heart failure, hypertension, and 
      other cardiovascular diseases, as well as cerebrovascular diseases and 
      Alzheimer's disease. It also discusses the clinical implications of utilizing PWV 
      to monitor treatment outcomes, various challenges in implementing PWV assessment 
      in clinical practice, and the development of new technologies, including machine 
      learning and artificial intelligence, which may improve the usefulness of PWV 
      measurements in the future. Measuring arterial stiffness through PWV remains an 
      important technique to study aging, especially as the technology continues to 
      evolve. There is a clear need to leverage PWV to identify interventions 
      that mitigate age-related increases in PWV, potentially improving CVD outcomes 
      and promoting healthy vascular aging.

AB  - A vast progress has been made in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases 
      during the past few years. However, clinical diagnostic accuracy continues to be 
      very low, despite the introduction of various diagnostic tools and repeated 
      revisions of diagnostic criteria. For instance, patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) may present with symptoms that overlap with other neurodegenerative 
      conditions like dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), making accurate diagnosis 
      challenging. This diagnostic uncertainty can lead to delayed or incorrect 
      treatment, significantly impacting patients' quality of life and prognosis. Thus, 
      the definite diagnosis still relies on post-mortem pathological findings, placing 
      a significant burden on both clinicians and researchers. As a growing body of 
      evidence indicates, co-pathology seems to be the rule among neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Additionally, a single pathological diagnosis, such as AD, can manifest 
      in various clinical presentations, ranging from predominantly cognitive 
      impairment to significant motor symptoms. Each of these presentations currently 
      requires its own set of complicated diagnostic criteria. Perhaps, the time has 
      come for a much-needed radical revision of existing clinical diagnostic criteria. 
      Inclusion of patients do not neatly fit into existing diagnostic categories for 
      neurodegenerative diseases, in future large-scale, longitudinal studies and/or 
      clinical trials, and systematic assessment of their clinical features and disease 
      progression using machine learning could generate valuable data on patients with 
      mixed pathologies and improve our understanding of how to effectively treat these 
      complex cases.

      decline in neuropsychiatric disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 7690

AB  - The unmet timely diagnosis requirements, that take place years after substantial 
      neural loss and neuroperturbations in neuropsychiatric disorders, affirm the dire 
      need for biomarkers with proven efficacy. In Parkinson's disease (PD), Mild 
      Cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimers disease (AD) and psychiatric disorders, it 
      is difficult to detect early symptoms given their mild nature. We hypothesize 
      that employing fine motor patterns, derived from natural interactions with 
      keyboards, also knwon as keystroke dynamics, could translate classic finger 
      dexterity tests from clinics to populations in-the-wild for timely diagnosis, 
      yet, further evidence is required to prove this efficiency. We have searched 
      PubMED, Medline, IEEEXplore, EBSCO and Web of Science for eligible diagnostic 
      accuracy studies employing keystroke dynamics as an index test for the detection 
      of neuropsychiatric disorders as the main target condition. We evaluated the 
      diagnostic performance of keystroke dynamics across 41 studies published between 
      2014 and March 2022, comprising 3791 PD patients, 254 MCI patients, and 374 
      psychiatric disease patients. Of these, 25 studies were included in univariate 
      random-effect meta-analysis models for diagnostic performance assessment. Pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity are 0.86 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.82-0.90, 
      I(2) = 79.49%) and 0.83 (CI 0.79-0.87, I(2) = 83.45%) for PD, 0.83 (95% CI 
      0.65-1.00, I(2) = 79.10%) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.93, I(2) = 0%) for psychomotor 
      impairment, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.74-0.96, I(2) = 50.39%) and 0.82 (95% CI 
      0.70-0.94, I(2) = 87.73%) for MCI and early AD, respectively. Our subgroup 
      analyses conveyed the diagnosis efficiency of keystroke dynamics for naturalistic 
      self-reported data, and the promising performance of multimodal analysis of 
      naturalistic behavioral data and deep learning methods in detecting 
      disease-induced phenotypes. The meta-regression models showed the increase in 
      diagnostic accuracy and fine motor impairment severity index with age and disease 
      duration for PD and MCI. The risk of bias, based on the QUADAS-2 tool, is deemed 
      low to moderate and overall, we rated the quality of evidence to be moderate. We 
      conveyed the feasibility of keystroke dynamics as digital biomarkers for fine 
      motor decline in naturalistic environments. Future work to evaluate their 
      performance for longitudinal disease monitoring and therapeutic implications is 
      yet to be performed. We eventually propose a partnership strategy based on a 
      "co-creation" approach that stems from mechanistic explanations of patients' 
      characteristics derived from data obtained in-clinics and under ecologically 
      valid settings. The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis is 
      registered in PROSPERO; identifier CRD42021278707. The presented work is

AB  - The number of diagnoses and drug prescriptions for dementia patients is poorly 
      available. Delay in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), for which missed 
      diagnoses amount to over half cases, and undertreatment of chronic and 
      neuropathic pain mirroring excessive use of harmful antipsychotics and 
      antidepressants is reported. Our study aimed at diagnosing AD through the most 
      advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies even in patients who escaped 
      clinical observation. To this end, pharmacoepidemiology data collected as part of 
      the first retrospective community study in a wide sample of 298,000 individuals, 
      84,235 aged over 60 years, were used to set up an AI algorithm for the rescue of 
      missed diagnoses of AD. The core of the algorithm consisted in the management of 
      time series represented by pharmacological therapies through a distance matrix 
      and in the use of autoencoders. Patients without a diagnosis of AD based on 
      pharmacotherapy were 114.920, while diagnosed patients were 1.150, mainly aged 
      between 75 and 84 years, pointing at late start of treatment. Increased use of 
      antidepressants, neuroleptics, and mood stabilizers is found in patients treated 
      with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine, while nonsteroidal 
      anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol-codeine and opioids are mostly prescribed to 
      patients not receiving AChEIs and memantine. The classification model 
      demonstrated good global accuracy at the end of training, equal to 79.12%. 
      Further studies and longitudinal monitoring of patients are needed to improve 
      disease detection and management. The deep learning-based pharmacoutilization 
      algorithm generated in the present study will aid the diagnosis of AD and the 
      understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms treatment.

AB  - The recognition and classification of facial expressions using artificial 
      intelligence (AI) presents a promising avenue for early detection and monitoring 
      of neurodegenerative disorders. This narrative review critically examines the 
      current state of AI-driven facial expression analysis in the context of 
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We discuss 
      the potential of AI techniques, including deep learning and computer vision, to 
      accurately interpret and categorize subtle changes in facial expressions 
      associated with these pathological conditions. Furthermore, we explore 
      the role of facial expression recognition as a noninvasive, cost-effective tool 
      for screening, disease progression tracking, and personalized intervention in 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The review also addresses the challenges, ethical 
      considerations, and future prospects of integrating AI-based facial expression 
      analysis into clinical practice for early intervention and improved quality of 
      life for individuals at risk of or affected by neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Dementia can change oculomotor behavior, which is detectable through 
      eye-tracking. This study aims to systematically review and conduct a 
      meta-analysis of current literature on the intersection between eye-tracking and 
      artificial intelligence (AI) in detecting dementia. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, 
      Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and IEEE databases were searched up to July 
      2023. All types of studies that utilized eye-tracking and AI to detect dementia 
      and reported the performance metrics, were included. Data on the dementia type, 
      performance, artificial intelligence, and eye-tracking paradigms were extracted. 
      The registered protocol is available online on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42023451996). 
      RESULTS: Nine studies were finally included with a sample size ranging from 57 to 
      583 participants. Alzheimer's disease (AD) was the most common dementia type. Six 
      studies used a machine learning model while three used a deep learning model. 
      Meta-analysis revealed the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of using 
      eye-tracking and artificial intelligence in detecting dementia, 88% [95% CI 
      (83%-92%)], 85% [95% CI (75%-93%)], and 86% [95% CI (79%-93%)], respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: Eye-tracking coupled with AI revealed promising results in terms of 
      dementia detection. Further studies must incorporate larger sample sizes, 
      standardized guidelines, and include other dementia types.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of individuals worldwide and is 
      considered a serious global health issue due to its gradual neuro-degenerative 
      effects on cognitive abilities such as memory, thinking, and behavior. There is 
      no cure for this disease but early detection along with a supportive care plan 
      may aid in improving the quality of life for patients. Automated detection of AD 
      is challenging because its symptoms vary in patients due to genetic, 
      environmental, or other co-existing health conditions. In recent years, multiple 
      researchers have proposed automated detection methods for AD using MRI and fMRI. 
      These approaches are expensive, have poor temporal resolution, do not offer 
      real-time insights, and have not proven to be very accurate. In contrast, only a 
      limited number of studies have explored the potential of Electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) signals for AD detection. In contrast, Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals 
      present a cost-effective, non-invasive, and high-temporal-resolution alternative 
      for AD detection. Despite their potential, the application of EEG signals in AD 
      research remains under-explored. This study reviews publicly available EEG 
      datasets, the variety of machine learning models developed for automated AD 
      detection, and the performance metrics achieved by these methods. It provides a 
      critical analysis of existing approaches, highlights challenges, and identifies 
      key areas requiring further investigation. Key findings include a detailed 
      evaluation of current methodologies, prevailing trends, and potential gaps in the 
      field. What sets this work apart is its in-depth analysis of EEG signals for 
      Alzheimer's Disease detection, providing a stronger and more reliable foundation 
      for understanding the potential role of EEG in this area.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) as the second 
      most common dementia encompasses a range of syndromes and often shows overlapping 
      symptoms with other subtypes or neurodegenerative diseases, which poses a 
      significant clinical diagnostic challenge. Recent advancements in artificial 
      intelligence (AI), specifically the application of machine learning (ML) 
      algorithms to neuroimaging, have significantly progressed in addressing this 
      challenge. This study aims to assess the diagnostic and predictive efficacy of 
      neuroimaging feature-based AI algorithms for FTLD. METHODS: We conducted a 
      systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. We searched 
      Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science for English-language, peer-reviewed studies 
      using the following three umbrella terms: artificial intelligence, frontotemporal 
      lobar degeneration, and neuroimaging modality. Our survey focused on 
      computer-aided diagnosis for FTLD, employing machine/deep learning with 
      neuroimaging radiomic features. RESULTS: The meta-analysis includes 75 articles 
      with 20,601 subjects, including 8,051 FTLD patients. The results reveal that FTLD 
      can be automatically classified against healthy controls (HC) with pooled 
      sensitivity and specificity of 86% and 89%, respectively. Likewise, FTLD versus 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification exhibits pooled sensitivity and 
      specificity of 84% and 81%, while FTLD versus Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      demonstrates pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 75%, respectively. 
      Classification performance distinguishing FTLD from atypical Parkinsonian 
      syndromes (APS) showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 79%, 
      respectively. Multiclass classification sensitivity ranges from 42% to 100%, with 
      lower sensitivity occurring in higher class distinctions (e.g., 5-class and 
      11-class). DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing 
      neuroimaging features to distinguish FTLD from HC, AD, APS, and PD in binary 
      classification. Utilizing deep learning with multimodal neuroimaging data to 
      differentiate FTLD subtypes and perform multiclassification among FTLD and other 
      neurodegenerative disease holds promise for expediting diagnosis. In sum, the 
      meta-analysis supports translation of machine learning tools in combination with 
      imaging to clinical routine paving the way to precision medicine.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has recently emerged as a potent 
      analytical technique with significant potential in the field of brain research. 
      This review explores the applications and innovations of SERS in understanding 
      the pathophysiological basis and diagnosis of brain disorders. SERS holds 
      significant advantages over conventional Raman spectroscopy, particularly in 
      terms of sensitivity and stability. The integration of label-free SERS presents 
      promising opportunities for the rapid, reliable, and non-invasive diagnosis of 
      brain-associated diseases, particularly when combined with advanced computational 
      methods such as machine learning. SERS has potential to deepen our understanding 
      of brain diseases, enhancing diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutic 
      interventions. Such advancements could significantly enhance the accuracy of 
      clinical diagnosis and further our understanding of brain-related processes and 
      diseases. This review assesses the utility of SERS in diagnosing and 
      understanding the pathophysiological basis of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's 
      and Parkinson's diseases, stroke, and brain cancer. Recent technological advances 
      in SERS instrumentation and techniques are discussed, including innovations in 
      nanoparticle design, substrate materials, and imaging technologies. We also 
      explore prospects and emerging trends, offering insights into new technologies, 
      while also addressing various challenges and limitations associated with SERS in 
      brain research.

AB  - The intricate relationship between cardiovascular health and cognitive function 
      has emerged as a critical area of research in neurodegenerative diseases. This 
      review explored the role of cardiac biomarkers as predictors of cognitive 
      decline, elucidating the types, mechanisms, and clinical implications of these 
      molecular indicators. We examined established biomarkers such as troponins, 
      natriuretic peptides, and C-reactive protein, as well as emerging soluble 
      biomarkers and microRNAs. The mechanisms linking cardiac dysfunction to cognitive 
      decline were discussed, including vascular damage, neuroinflammation, and 
      neurohormonal imbalances. Evidence from clinical studies demonstrated 
      associations between elevated cardiac biomarkers and structural brain changes, as 
      well as a decline in memory and executive function. Despite promising findings, 
      current research faces limitations, including population-specific biases, limited 
      biomarker diversity, and incomplete understanding of pathophysiological 
      mechanisms. We highlighted the clinical implications of incorporating cardiac 
      biomarkers into cognitive health assessments, emphasizing their potential for 
      early detection, risk stratification, and personalized management strategies. The 
      integration of cardiac biomarkers with neuroimaging, genetic data, and 
      neuropsychological assessments is recognized to offer a comprehensive approach to 
      managing high-risk populations. Looking ahead, we identified key areas for future 
      research, including the need for large-scale, longitudinal studies across diverse 
      populations, the exploration of novel biomarkers, and the application of 
      artificial intelligence to enhance predictive models. The potential of cardiac 
      biomarkers in public health initiatives and preventive screening programs was 
      also discussed. Cardiac biomarkers represent a vital link between heart and brain 
      health, offering valuable insights into the complex pathways of cognitive 
      deterioration in neurodegenerative diseases. Their integration into clinical 
      practice holds promise for improving outcomes and quality of life for individuals 
      at risk of, or suffering from, cognitive decline worldwide.

AB  - BackgroundAlzheimer's disease (AD), marked by progressive memory loss and 
      cognitive decline, poses diagnostic challenges due to its multifactorial nature. 
      Therefore, researchers are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence and 
      data-driven approaches to develop computerized clinical decision support systems 
      (CCDSS), aiming to enhance early detection, improve treatment, and slow disease 
      progression.ObjectiveThis study seeks to conduct a systematic review of the most 
      recently developed AD-CCDSS, delving into their progress and the challenges to 
      guide future development and implementation of CCDSS for AD-related 
      decision-making and intervention strategies.MethodsWe follow the PRISMA 2020 
      guideline to search for articles published within the past seven years across 
      PubMed, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Web of Science, and Scopus, 
      with Google Scholar as a supplementary source. Key components are then extracted 
      from the selected studies for qualitative analysis, including data modalities, 
      computational modeling approaches, system explainability and interpretability, 
      research priorities, and graphical user interfaces designed for non-technical 
      stakeholders.ResultsAfter searching and removing duplicates, we meticulously 
      selected 55 studies. After reviewing key components of CCDSS, we highlight 
      advancements and potential clinical applications, demonstrating their promise in 
      enhancing decision support. However, despite growing attention to explainability 
      in AD-CCDSS, its clinical applicability remains limited. Moreover, challenges 
      such as multi-center system interoperability and data security remain 
      underexplored, hindering real-world implementation.ConclusionsThis study analyzes 
      recent translational AD-CCDSS, identifying key challenges in advancing CCDSS for 
      clinical applications. It offers insights for researchers to enhance CCDSS 
      development and facilitate their integration into clinical practice.

AB  - To develop a new method for measuring Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific 
      similarity of cortical atrophy patterns at the individual-level, we employed an 
      individual-level machine learning algorithm. A total of 869 cognitively normal 
      (CN) individuals and 473 patients with probable AD dementia who underwent 
      high-resolution 3T brain MRI were included. We propose a machine learning-based 
      method for measuring the similarity of an individual subject's cortical atrophy 
      pattern with that of a representative AD patient cohort. In addition, we 
      validated this similarity measure in two longitudinal cohorts consisting of 79 
      patients with amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 27 patients with 
      probable AD dementia. Surface-based morphometry classifier for discriminating AD 
      from CN showed sensitivity and specificity values of 87.1% and 93.3%, 
      respectively. In the longitudinal validation study, aMCI-converts had higher 
      atrophy similarity at both baseline (p < 0.001) and first year visits (p < 0.001) 
      relative to non-converters. Similarly, AD patients with faster decline had higher 
      atrophy similarity than slower decliners at baseline (p = 0.042), first year 
      (p = 0.028), and third year visits (p = 0.027). The AD-specific atrophy 
      similarity measure is a novel approach for the prediction of dementia risk and 
      for the evaluation of AD trajectories on an individual subject level.

TI  - Clinical Decision Support Using Speech Signal Analysis: Systematic Scoping Review 
      of Neurological Disorders.
PG  - e63004
LID - 10.2196/63004 [doi]
LID - e63004
AB  - BACKGROUND: Digital biomarkers are increasingly used in clinical decision support 
      for various health conditions. Speech features as digital biomarkers can offer 
      insights into underlying physiological processes due to the complexity of speech 
      production. This process involves respiration, phonation, articulation, and 
      resonance, all of which rely on specific motor systems for the preparation and 
      execution of speech. Deficits in any of these systems can cause changes in speech 
      signal patterns. Increasing efforts are being made to develop speech-based 
      clinical decision support systems. OBJECTIVE: This systematic scoping review 
      investigated the technological revolution and recent digital clinical speech 
      signal analysis trends to understand the key concepts and research processes from 
      clinical and technical perspectives. METHODS: A systematic scoping review was 
      undertaken in 6 databases guided by a set of research questions. Articles that 
      focused on speech signal analysis for clinical decision-making were identified, 
      and the included studies were analyzed quantitatively. A narrower scope of 
      studies investigating neurological diseases were analyzed using qualitative 
      content analysis. RESULTS: A total of 389 articles met the initial eligibility 
      criteria, of which 72 (18.5%) that focused on neurological diseases were included 
      in the qualitative analysis. In the included studies, Parkinson disease, 
      Alzheimer disease, and cognitive disorders were the most frequently investigated 
      conditions. The literature explored the potential of speech feature analysis in 
      diagnosis, differentiating between, assessing the severity and monitoring the 
      treatment of neurological conditions. The common speech tasks used were sustained 
      phonations, diadochokinetic tasks, reading tasks, activity-based tasks, picture 
      descriptions, and prompted speech tasks. From these tasks, conventional speech 
      features (such as fundamental frequency, jitter, and shimmer), advanced digital 
      signal processing-based speech features (such as wavelet transformation-based 
      features), and spectrograms in the form of audio images were analyzed. 
      Traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches were used to build 
      predictive models, whereas statistical analysis assessed variable relationships 
      and reliability of speech features. Model evaluations primarily focused on 
      analytical validations. A significant research gap was identified: the need for a 
      structured research process to guide studies toward potential technological 
      intervention in clinical settings. To address this, a research framework was 
      proposed that adapts a design science research methodology to guide research 
      studies systematically. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight how data science 
      techniques can enhance speech signal analysis to support clinical 
      decision-making. By combining knowledge from clinical practice, speech science, 
      and data science within a structured research framework, future research may 
      achieve greater clinical relevance.

TI  - Advances in flexible sensor monitoring technology for neurodegenerative diseases 
      in the elderly.
LID - 10.1088/1361-6528/adddc5 [doi]
AB  - The aging population has led to a rise in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like 
      Alzheimer's and Parkinson's creating significant public health challenges. 
      Traditional monitoring methods often lack continuity and real-time data, limiting 
      their effectiveness. Advances in flexible sensors, combined with artificial 
      intelligence and big data analytics, enable real-time analysis of multi-parameter 
      physiological data, improving detection rates and supporting personalized 
      treatment. Innovations such as self-powered triboelectric nanogenerators and 
      graphene-based materials further enhance sensor reliability and efficiency, 
      ensuring seamless patient monitoring. This article discusses the integration of 
      flexible sensors with modern monitoring devices, focusing on advancements in 
      sensor design optimization, energy management circuits, and intelligent data 
      processing algorithms. These innovations aim to develop robust, self-sustaining 
      systems for accurate, real-time health data monitoring. Such systems hold promise 
      for enabling early interventions and enhancing the quality of life for elderly 
      patients.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Little is known about structural brain changes in type 1 diabetes 
      (T1D) and whether there are early manifestations of a neurodegenerative condition 
      like Alzheimer disease (AD) or evidence of premature brain aging. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate neuroimaging markers of brain age and AD-like atrophy in participants 
      with T1D in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT)/Epidemiology of 
      Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study, identify which brain 
      regions are associated with the greatest changes in patients with T1D, and assess 
      the association between cognition and brain aging indices. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study leveraged data collected during the combined DCCT 
      (randomized clinical trial, 1983-1993) and EDIC (observational study, 1994 to 
      present) studies at 27 clinical centers in the US and Canada. A total of 416 
      eligible EDIC participants and 99 demographically similar adults without diabetes 
      were enrolled in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ancillary study, which 
      reports cross-sectional data collected in 2018 to 2019 and relates it to factors 
      measured longitudinally in DCCT/EDIC. Data analyses were performed between July 
      2020 and April 2022. EXPOSURE: T1D diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Psychomotor and mental efficiency were evaluated using verbal fluency, digit 
      symbol substitution test, trail making part B, and the grooved pegboard. 
      Immediate memory scores were derived from the logical memory subtest of the 
      Wechsler memory scale and the Wechsler digit symbol substitution test. MRI and 
      machine learning indices were calculated to predict brain age and quantify 
      AD-like atrophy. RESULTS: This study included 416 EDIC participants with a median 
      (range) age of 60 (44-74) years (87 of 416 [21%] were older than 65 years) and a 
      median (range) diabetes duration of 37 (30-51) years. EDIC participants had 
      consistently higher brain age values compared with controls without diabetes, 
      indicative of approximately 6 additional years of brain aging (EDIC participants: 
      β, 6.16; SE, 0.71; control participants: β, 1.04; SE, 0.04; P < .001). In 
      contrast, AD regional atrophy was comparable between the 2 groups. Regions with 
      atrophy in EDIC participants vs controls were observed mainly in the bilateral 
      thalamus and putamen. Greater brain age was associated with lower psychomotor and 
      mental efficiency among EDIC participants (β, -0.04; SE, 0.01; P < .001), but not 
      among controls. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest an 
      increase in brain aging among individuals with T1D without any early signs of 
      AD-related neurodegeneration. These increases were associated with reduced 
      cognitive performance, but overall, the abnormal patterns seen in this sample 
      were modest, even after a mean of 38 years with T1D.

AB  - Prediction models have been developed to identify mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
      cases likely to convert to dementia. This systematic review summarizes 
      multi-source prediction models for MCI to dementia conversion. PubMed and Embase 
      were searched for model development and validation studies from inception up to 
      January 18 2024. Models were assessed for included predictors, predictive 
      performance, risk of bias, and generalizability. 62 studies were included: 41 
      machine learning models, 11 regression models, and 5 disease state indexes. The 
      number of predictors in the models ranged from 2 to 60; magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) and cognitive scores were the most common sources. Performance 
      measures indicate reasonable predictive capabilities (area under the curve [AUC] 
      range: 0.58-0.98, accuracy range: 66.1-96.3%); however, most studies are at high 
      risk of bias and 47 studies lack external validation. Currently, no highly valid 
      prediction model is available for MCI to dementia conversion risk due to limited 
      generalizability and high risk of bias in most studies. HIGHLIGHTS: Numerous 
      models have been developed to predict the likelihood of conversion to dementia in 
      individuals with MCI. Prediction models seem to have a reasonably good 
      performance in predicting conversion to dementia, however, external validation 
      and generalizability is often lacking. There is no prediction model available 
      with a low risk for bias and that has been externally validated to accurately 
      predict the risk of MCI to dementia conversion. For MCI to dementia conversion 
      prediction models, more emphasis should be directed towards external validation, 
      generalizability, and clinical applicability.

AB  - Computer aided diagnostic (CAD) has become a significant tool in expanding 
      patient quality-of-life by reducing human errors in diagnosis. CAD can expedite 
      decision-making on complex clinical data automatically. Since brain diseases can 
      be fatal, rapid identification of brain pathology to prolong patient life is an 
      important research topic. Many algorithms have been proposed for efficient brain 
      pathology identification (BPI) over the past decade. Constant refinement of the 
      various image processing algorithms must take place to expand performance of the 
      automatic BPI task. In this paper, a systematic survey of contemporary BPI 
      algorithms using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presented. A 
      summarization of recent literature provides investigators with a helpful synopsis 
      of the domain. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of BPI, future research 
      directions are indicated.

AB  - Cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), pose a 
      global health crisis, necessitating non-invasive biomarkers for early detection. 
      This review highlights the retina, an accessible extension of the central nervous 
      system (CNS), as a window to cerebral pathology through structural, functional, 
      and molecular alterations. By synthesizing interdisciplinary evidence, we 
      identify retinal biomarkers as promising tools for early diagnosis and risk 
      stratification. Nevertheless, translating biomarkers into clinical practice faces 
      significant translational hurdles, including methodological heterogeneity, 
      confounding variables, lack of standardized protocols, and insufficient 
      longitudinal validation in diverse populations. Overcoming these challenges 
      through rigorous standardization and robust validation studies is essential to 
      establish the clinical utility of retinal biomarkers. HIGHLIGHTS: Stage-specific 
      diagnostic potential: Retinal biomarkers (e.g., OCT/OCTA changes, eye movements, 
      molecular deposits) show alterations correlating with cognitive impairment stages 
      (preclinical AD to dementia), assisting stage differentiation. Reflecting 
      cerebral pathology: Multimodal retinal alterations (structural, functional, 
      molecular) correlate with key brain pathologies (amyloid/tau burden, atrophy, 
      small vessel disease), indicating shared pathways. Translation gaps and 
      future: Clinical adoption faces barriers (method heterogeneity, confounders, 
      limited validation). Future requires rigorous screening of candidate retinal 
      biomarkers, extensive multicenter validation, and artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-facilitated clinical translation.

TI  - From suspicion of cognitive decline to dementia diagnosis: a systematic review of 
      healthcare professionals' considerations and attitudes.
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afaf176 [doi]
LID - afaf176
AB  - BACKGROUND: Initiating diagnostic testing for dementia is a dynamic and complex 
      process that often involves balancing competing interests. This systematic review 
      aims to provide an overview of healthcare professionals' considerations and 
      attitudes during the process from suspicion of cognitive decline to deciding to 
      initiate diagnostic testing. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and 
      PsychINFO) were systematically searched on 29 January 2024 for qualitative and 
      mixed-methods studies published since 2005. Search concepts were: 'dementia', 
      'considerations and attitudes', 'healthcare professionals' and 'diagnosis'. Two 
      screeners independently conducted title/abstract-screening using ASReview 
      (efficient and transparent systematic review machine learning framework), and 
      full-text screening. Findings were analysed by thematic synthesis. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-three studies were included. Most involved primary care physicians 
      (n = 25), primary care nurses (n = 1) or a combination (n = 7). The overarching 
      phenomenon was that starting the diagnostic workup for dementia is a delicate 
      process. Clusters influencing this process were: complexities arising from the 
      nature of dementia; interaction with the patient and family; individual 
      determinants of primary care practitioners (PCPs); expectations regarding the 
      consequences of a diagnosis; factors related to the healthcare system; and 
      societal factors. Together these clusters form PCPs' strategies and actions for 
      deciding whether to start the diagnostic workup. CONCLUSION: Initiating the 
      diagnostic workup for dementia is a delicate process influenced by various 
      factors including fear, reluctance and stigma. The different strategies that PCPs 
      use cannot be captured by a single right approach. Recommendations to better 
      support PCPs in navigating this complex process include ensuring consistent 
      communication and clarity about their roles, and promoting interprofessional 
      collaboration.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder for which 
      there is currently no cure, and its incidence is on the rise. Early detection is 
      essential for timely intervention and slowing the progression of the disease. 
      While the brain structures of healthy aging individuals change gradually, the 
      aging trajectories in AD patients deviate significantly. Recent advancements in 
      deep learning have enabled the detection of subtle changes in brain structures 
      using neuroimaging data. By developing brain age prediction models based on data 
      from healthy individuals, it is possible to estimate brain age at various stages 
      of AD progression and assess the Brain Age Gap (BAG)-the difference between 
      predicted brain age and chronological age-which holds promise as an early 
      diagnostic biomarker for AD. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence, 
      particularly deep learning, for brain age prediction has attracted considerable 
      attention. This systematic review provides a comprehensive summary of the current 
      state of research in this field, focusing on the progress and limitations of 
      machine learning techniques for brain age prediction. We place particular 
      emphasis on deep learning methods, addressing data sources, model development, 
      and interpretability. Additionally, we analyze key challenges in the field, 
      including site effects, bias correction, insufficient data, hardware 
      requirements, model accuracy, and clinical applicability. Finally, we offer 
      insights and recommendations for future research directions to address these 
      challenges and further enhance the potential of BAG as a diagnostic tool for AD.

      Neuroscience Perspective.
PG  - 33392
LID - 10.31083/JIN33392 [doi]
AB  - Nasal cytology is evolving into a promising tool for diagnosing neurological and 
      psychiatric disorders, especially those such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's 
      diseases. Moreover, recent research has indicated that biomarkers differ greatly 
      between samples taken before and after death. Nasal cytology might help to 
      identify the early stages of cognitive decline. The association of olfactory 
      disturbances with a host of these neurological disorders is remarkable. This 
      means that the nose, something we probably take for granted, could well be the 
      best means of establishing important biomarkers for earlier diagnoses in these 
      conditions. The nose is a source of epithelial and neuroepithelial cells that can 
      be used in in vitro cultured models and nasal cytology provides new avenues for 
      translational, integrative neuroscientific research. The future incorporation of 
      artificial intelligence into cytological analyses would facilitate the acceptance 
      of nasal cytology as a screening platform for neurodegenerative and psychiatric 
      conditions, facilitating early diagnosis and better management for patients.

TI  - Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunctions as a Basis for a Predictive Model of Risk 
      of Neurological Disorders in Subjects with Prior History of Traumatic Brain 
      Injury: Implications in Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 305-315
LID - 10.3233/JAD-160948 [doi]
AB  - Autonomic dysfunction is very common in patients with dementia, and its presence 
      might also help in differential diagnosis among dementia subtypes. Various 
      central nervous system structures affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are also 
      implicated in the central autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulation. For example, 
      deficits in central cholinergic function in AD could likely lead to autonomic 
      dysfunction. We recently developed a simple, readily applicable evaluation for 
      monitoring ANS disturbances in response to traumatic brain injury (TBI). This 
      ability to monitor TBI allows for the possible detection and targeted prevention 
      of long-term, detrimental brain responses caused by TBI that lead to 
      neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. We randomly selected and extracted 
      de-identified medical record information from subjects who have been assessed 
      using the ANS evaluation protocol. Using machine learning strategies in the 
      analysis of information from individual as well as a combination of ANS 
      evaluation protocol components, we identified a novel prediction model that is 
      effective in correctly segregating between cases with or without a documented 
      history of TBI exposure. Results from our study support the hypothesis that 
      trauma-induced ANS dysfunctions may contribute to clinical TBI features. Because 
      autonomic dysfunction is very common in AD patients it is possible that TBI may 
      also contribute to AD and/or other forms of dementia through these novel 
      mechanisms. This study provides a novel prediction model to physiologically 
      assess the likelihood of subjects with prior history of TBI to develop clinical 
      TBI complications, such as AD.
