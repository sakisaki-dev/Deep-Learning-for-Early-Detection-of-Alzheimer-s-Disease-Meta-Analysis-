  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a global neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Actual AD imaging datasets challenge the construction of reliable longitudinal models owing to imaging modality uncertainty. In addition, they are still unable to retain or obtain important information during disease progression from previous to followup time points. For example, the output values of current gates in recurrent models should be close to a specific value that indicates the model is uncertain about retaining or forgetting information. In this study, we propose a model which can extract and constrain each modality into a common representation space to capture intermodality interactions among different modalities associated with modality uncertainty to predict AD progression. In addition, we provide an auxiliary function to enhance the ability of recurrent gate robustly and effectively in controlling the flow of information over time using longitudinal data. We conducted comparative analysis on data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Our model outperformed other methods across all evaluation metrics. Therefore, the proposed model provides a promising solution for addressing modality uncertainty challenges in multimodal longitudinal AD progression prediction.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is mostly prevalent in people older than 65 years. The hippocampus is a widely studied region of interest (ROI) for a number of reasons, such as memory function analysis, stress development observation and neurological disorder investigation. Moreover, hippocampal volume atrophy is known to be linked with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, several biomarkers, such as amyloid beta (aß42) protein, tau, phosphorylated tau and hippocampal volume atrophy, are being used to diagnose AD. In this research work, we have proposed a method to diagnose AD based on slice-wise volumetric features extracted from the left and right hippocampi of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. The proposed method is an aggregation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a deep neural network (DNN) model. The left and right hippocampi have been localized automatically using a two-stage ensemble Hough-CNN. The localized hippocampal positions are used to extract (80 × 80x80 voxels) 3-D patches. The 2-D slices are then separated from the 3-D patches along axial, sagittal, and coronal views. The pre-processed 2-D patches are used to extract volumetric features from each slice by using a discrete volume estimation convolutional neural network (DVE-CNN) model. The extracted volumetric features have been used to train and test the classification network. The proposed approach has achieved average weighted classification accuracies of 94.82% and 94.02% based on the extracted volumetric features attributed to the left and right hippocampi, respectively. In addition, it has achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 92.54% and 90.62% for the left and right hippocampi, respectively. Our method has outperformed the other methods by a certain margin in the same dataset.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline, affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment, as it can slow disease progression and improve quality of life. Machine learning has shown promise in AD detection using various medical modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-level stacking model that combines heterogeneous models and modalities to predict different classes of AD. The modalities include cognitive sub-scores (e.g., clinical dementia rating – sum of boxes, Alzheimer’s disease assessment scale) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. In the proposed approach, in level 1, we used six base models (Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K-nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Native Bayes (NB)to train each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA). Then, we build stacking training that combines the outputs of each base model for the training set and staking testing that combines the outcomes of each model for the testing set. In level 2, three stacking models are produced for each modality that trains and evaluates based on the output of 6 base models based on (RF, LR, DT, SVM, KNN, and NB) are combined in training stacking for the training set and testing stacking for the testing set. Stacking training is used to train meta-learners (RF), and stacking testing is used to evaluate meta-learners (RF). Finally, in level 3, the output prediction of the stacking model from each modality (ADAS, CDR, and FQA) in the training and testing datasets is merged to build a new dataset, which is staking training and stacking testing. Training stacking is used to train the meta-learner, and the testing set is used to evaluate the meta-learner and produce the final prediction. Our research also aims to provide model explanations, ensuring efficiency, effectiveness, and trust through explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Feature selection optimization based on Particle Swarm Optimization is used to select the most appropriate sub-scores. The proposed model shows significant potential for improving early disease diagnosis. The results demonstrate that the multi-modality approach outperforms single-modality approaches. Moreover, the proposed multi-level stacking models achieve the highest performance with selected features compared to regular ML classifiers and stacking models using full multi-modalities, achieving accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores of 92.08%, 92.07%, 92.08%, and 92.01% for two classes, and 90.03%, 90.19%, 90.03%, and 90.05% for three classes, respectively.},

  abstract={Brain is the controlling center of our body. With the advent of time, newer and newer brain diseases are being discovered. Thus, because of the variability of brain diseases, existing diagnosis or detection systems are becoming challenging and are still an open problem for research. Detection of brain diseases at an early stage can make a huge difference in attempting to cure them. In recent years, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) is surging through all spheres of science, and no doubt, it is revolutionizing the field of neurology. Application of AI in medical science has made brain disease prediction and detection more accurate and precise. In this study, we present a review on recent machine learning and deep learning approaches in detecting four brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), brain tumor, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. 147 recent articles on four brain diseases are reviewed considering diverse machine learning and deep learning approaches, modalities, datasets etc. Twenty-two datasets are discussed which are used most frequently in the reviewed articles as a primary source of brain disease data. Moreover, a brief overview of different feature extraction techniques that are used in diagnosing brain diseases is provided. Finally, key findings from the reviewed articles are summarized and a number of major issues related to machine learning/deep learning-based brain disease diagnostic approaches are discussed. Through this study, we aim at finding the most accurate technique for detecting different brain diseases which can be employed for future betterment.},

  abstract={Many classical machine learning techniques have been used to explore Alzheimer's disease (AD), evolving from image decomposition techniques such as principal component analysis toward higher complexity, non-linear decomposition algorithms. With the arrival of the deep learning paradigm, it has become possible to extract high-level abstract features directly from MRI images that internally describe the distribution of data in low-dimensional manifolds. In this work, we try a new exploratory data analysis of AD based on deep convolutional autoencoders. We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of neuropsychological test outcomes, diagnoses, and other clinical data with the imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis, and the influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is estimated. The imaging-derived markers could then predict clinical variables with correlations above 0.6 in the case of neuropsychological evaluation variables such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores, achieving a classification accuracy over 80% for the diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive disease for which researchers have yet to discover the main cause, but believe it probably involves a combination of age-related changes in the brain, genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors. Alzheimer’s is an irreversible disease that still has no cure. Therefore, its early diagnosis is very important to prevent its progression. Developing Machine Learning algorithms in healthcare, especially in brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, provides new opportunities for early diagnosis and recognition of important biomarkers. This paper presents an overview of advanced studies based on Machine Learning techniques for diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease and different stages of mild cognitive impairment based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images in the last 10 years. Also, this paper comprehensively describes the commonly efficient Machine Learning algorithms in each stage of magnetic resonance imaging processing used in the papers, which can facilitate the comparison of algorithms with each other and provide insight into the impact of each technique on classification performance. This review can be a valuable resource to gain a new perspective on the various research methods used in recent studies on Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract={The anatomical structure of the brain has been studied with the help of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has been used to analyze numerous neurological diseases and define pathological areas. Early detection of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) patients is critical in order to implement preventative measures. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common chronic disease in the elderly, with a high incidence rate. In recent years, deep learning has seen a lot of success in the medical image analysis. Brain diseases can be more accurately categorized using segmented MRI scans due to in-depth analyses of tissue architecture. Many, complex segmentation approaches have been presented for AD diagnosis. Since deep learning algorithms can yield effective results over a large data collection, they have received interest for use in segmenting the brain’s structure and classifying AD. Consequently, the deep learning techniques are currently favored over machine learning techniques. We discuss how convolutional neural network concepts can be used to study brain anatomy in order to detect AD. New techniques, their results on open datasets, and the benefits of brain MRI segmentation for Alzheimer’s disease categorization are discussed. In this article, the literature on Alzheimer’s disease is briefly reviewed, and the possibility of Deep Learning to improve early diagnosis is discussed.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, incurable condition leading to decline of nerve cells and cognitive functions over time. Early detection is essential for improving quality of life, as treatment strategies aim to decelerate its progression. AD also impacts fine motor control, including handwriting. Utilizing machine learning (ML) with efficient data analysis methods for early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through handwriting analysis holds considerable promise for clinical diagnosis, albeit a challenging undertaking. In this study, we address this complexity by employing ensemble machine learning, which amalgamates diverse ML algorithms to enhance predictive performance. Our approach involves developing an ensemble model for analysis of handwriting kinetics, utilizing the stacking technique to integrate multiple base-level classifiers. The study encompasses 174 individuals, including 89 diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and 85 healthy participants, drawn from the DARWIN dataset (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting). To discern the most effective base classifiers, we employ both Repeated-k-fold and Monte-Carlo Cross Validation techniques. Subsequently, top k features are selected for each best-performing base classifier using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and recursive feature elimination (RFE). The final step involves consolidating predictions from the base classifiers through a stacking ensemble, resulting in an impressive performance. The ensemble model achieves 97.14% accuracy, 95% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% precision, 97.44% F1-score, 94.37% Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), 94.21% Cohen Kappa, and 97.5% Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). Comparative performance analysis demonstrates that our proposed model surpasses all state-of-the-art models based on the DARWIN dataset for Alzheimer’s disease prediction. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning to offer highly accurate predictions for Alzheimer’s disease in an affordable and non-invasive manner, emphasizing its significant clinical utility, particularly through handwriting analysis.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease, a leading neurodegenerative disorder, poses significant challenges to modern healthcare, emphasizing the urgent need for precise early-stage diagnostics. Despite promising insights from neuroimaging into potential AD biomarkers, the intricacy of data interpretation demands advanced computational techniques. Existing diagnostic tools have yet to fully harness the combined strengths of neuroimaging and modern deep-learning architectures for nuanced, early-stage AD classification. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that ensembles three state-of-the-art architectures—EfficientNetB7, Xception, and MobileNetV3Large—through a soft-voting strategy to classify Alzheimer’s disease across multiple stages. Our ensemble methodology deciphers complex patterns within Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mapping them to specific AD early stages. Integrating pre-trained model weights and adaptive learning rates ensures swift convergence and optimal performance. Benchmarking against a comprehensive AD neuro-imaging dataset revealed that our ensemble approach achieves a groundbreaking precision of 99.87%. These results significantly surpass those of individual architectures addressing this problem. Evaluation metrics like precision-recall and f1 score nearly approached 100% across different experiment stages. With inference times as low as 3ms for MobileNetV3Large, our model is highly suitable for real-time deployment in clinical environments. Furthermore, Grad-CAM explainability is incorporated to highlight critical brain regions contributing to the model’s predictions, improving clinical trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first ensemble-based deep learning framework combining EfficientNetB7, Xception, and MobileNetV3Large for multi-stage Alzheimer’s classification. The proposed hybrid model can confidently replace conventional diagnostic methods. As medical science is quickly changing and adapting AI decisions, our methodology is helpful for early diagnosis of dementia detection in the early stages of preemptive treatment.},

  abstract={Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an early stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is currently incurable. Early diagnosis of AD is essential for effective intervention since the World Alzheimer’s Report 2015 predicted the number of cases will triple by 2050. The 18F-FDG PET imaging technique, although effective in detecting metabolic activities in the brain, faces challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios and limited data availability, which complicates the extraction of necessary lesion information that is effective for early stage MCI diagnose. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning-based model, ResGLPyramid, that combines convolution operations, MobileViTv3, and a global-local attention module (GLAM) block, to capture local and global representations. By utilizing a softened cross-entropy (SCE) objective function, the model reduces overfitting, improves generalization, and enhances the detection of subtle metabolic changes. The proposed model enhances the sensitivity and specificity of Alzheimer’s detection by leveraging local- and long-range interactions among critical diagnostic features that lead to more precise and efficient analyses. The experimental results show that the ResGLPyramid model achieved an accuracy of 92.75%, sensitivity of 90.80%, and specificity of 94.14% in classifying MCI and AD individuals. These results represent a 3.44% increase in accuracy and a 4.28% increase in specificity while the sensitivity is slightly lower compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease affecting cognitive and functional abilities. However, many patients presume lower cognitive or functional abilities because of aging and do not undergo clinical assessments until the symptoms become too advanced. Developing a low-cost and easy-to-use AD detection tool, which can be used in any clinical or non-clinical setting, can enable widespread AD assessments and diagnosis. This paper investigated the feasibility of developing such a tool to detect AD vs. healthy control (HC) from a simple balance and walking assessment called the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. We collected joint position data of 47 HC and 38 AD subjects as they performed TUG in front of a Kinect V.2 camera. Our signal processing and statistical analyses provided a comprehensive analysis of balance and gait with 12 significant features for discriminating AD from HC after adjusting for age and the Geriatric Depression Scale. Using these features and a support vector machine classifier, our model classified the two groups with an average accuracy of 97.75% and an F-score of 97.67% for five-fold cross-validation and 98.68% and 98.67% for leave-one-subject out cross-validation. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach as a new quantitative complementary tool for detecting AD among older adults. Our work is novel as it presents the first application of Kinect V.2 camera and machine learning to provide a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the TUG test to detect AD patients from HC. This study supports the feasibility of developing a low-cost and convenient AD assessment tool that can be used during routine checkups or even at home; however, future investigations could confirm its clinical diagnostic value in a larger cohort.},

  abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that can cause a significant impairment in physical and cognitive functions. Gait disturbances are also reported as a symptom of AD. Previous works have used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze data provided by motion sensors that monitor Alzheimer's patients. However, these works have not explored continual learning algorithms that allow the CNN to configure itself as it receives new data from these sensors. This work proposes a method aimed at enabling CNNs to learn from a continuous stream of data from motion sensors without having full access to previous data. The CNN identifies the stage of AD from the analysis of data provided by motion sensors. The work includes an experimentation with data captured by accelerometers that monitored the activity of 35 Alzheimer's patients for a week in a daycare center. The CNN achieves an accuracy of 86,94%, 86,48% and 84,37% for 2, 3 and 4 experiences respectively. The proposal provides advantages to working with a continuous stream of data so that the CNN are constantly self-configuring without the intervention of a human. The work can be considered as promising and helpful in finding deep learning solutions in medical cases in which patients are constantly monitored.},

  abstract={In Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) brain disease classification is a vital issue. Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and brain tumors are the primary reasons of death. The studies of these diseases are carried out by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Computed Tomography (CT) scans which require expertise to understand the modality. The disease is the most prevalent in the elderly and can be fatal in its later stages. The result can be determined by calculating the mini-mental state exam score, following which the MRI scan of the brain is successful. Apart from that, various classification algorithms, such as machine learning and deep learning, are useful for diagnosing MRI scans. However, they do have some limitations in terms of accuracy. This paper proposes some insightful pre-processing methods that significantly improve the classification performance of these MRI images. Additionally, it reduced the time it took to train the model of various pre-existing learning algorithms. A dataset was obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neurological Initiative (ADNI) and converted from a 4D format to a 2D format. Selective clipping, grayscale image conversion, and histogram equalization techniques were used to pre-process the images. After pre-processing, we proposed three learning algorithms for AD classification, that is random forest, XGBoost, and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN). Results are computed on dataset and show that it outperformed with exiting work in terms of accuracy is 97.57% and sensitivity is 97.60%.},

In this work, we adapted and trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on sMRI images of the brain from ADNI datasets available in online databases. Our proposed mechanism was used to combine features from different layers to hierarchically transform the images from magnetic resonance imaging into more compact high-level features. The proposed method has a reduced number of parameters which reduces the computation complexity. The method is compared with the existing state-of-the-art works for AD classification, which show superior results for the widely used evaluation metrics, including accuracy, an area under the ROC curve, etc., suggesting that our proposed convolution operation is suitable for the AD diagnosis},

  abstract={Retinal optical coherence tomography (OCT) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) have emerged as promising, non-invasive, and cost-effective modalities for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, a comprehensive review of automated deep learning techniques for diagnosing AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using OCT/OCTA data is lacking. We addressed this gap by conducting a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We systematically searched databases, including Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science, and identified 16 important studies from an initial set of 4006 references. We then analyzed these studies through a structured framework, focusing on the key aspects of deep learning workflows for AD/MCI diagnosis using OCT-OCTA. This included dataset curation, model training, and validation methodologies. Our findings indicate a shift towards employing end-to-end deep learning models to directly analyze OCT/OCTA images in diagnosing AD/MCI, moving away from traditional machine learning approaches. However, we identified inconsistencies in the data collection methods across studies, leading to varied outcomes. We emphasize the need for longitudinal studies on early AD and MCI diagnosis, along with further research on interpretability tools to enhance model accuracy and reliability for clinical translation.},

  pages={218-226},
  abstract={The successful development of amyloid-based biomarkers and tests for Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents an important milestone in AD diagnosis. However, two major limitations remain. Amyloid-based diagnostic biomarkers and tests provide limited information about the disease process and they are unable to identify individuals with the disease before significant amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain develops. The objective in this study is to develop a method to identify potential blood-based non-amyloid biomarkers for early AD detection. The use of blood is attractive because it is accessible and relatively inexpensive. Our method is mainly based on machine learning (ML) techniques (support vector machines in particular) because of their ability to create multivariable models by learning patterns from complex data. Using novel feature selection and evaluation modalities, we identified 5 novel panels of non-amyloid proteins with the potential to serve as biomarkers of early AD. In particular, we found that the combination of A2M, ApoE, BNP, Eot3, RAGE and SGOT may be a key biomarker profile of early disease. Disease detection models based on the identified panels achieved sensitivity (SN) > 80%, specificity (SP) > 70%, and area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of at least 0.80 at prodromal stage (with higher performance at later stages) of the disease. Existing ML models performed poorly in comparison at this stage of the disease, suggesting that the underlying protein panels may not be suitable for early disease detection. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of early detection of AD using non-amyloid based biomarkers.},

  abstract={Background. Psychophysiological and cognitive tests as well as other functional studies can detect pre-symptomatic stages of dementia. When assembled with structural data, cognitive tests diagnose NDs more reliably thus becoming a multimodal diagnostic tool. Objective. Our main goal is to improve screening for dementia by studying an association between the brain structure and its function. Hypothetically, the brain structure-function association has features specific for either disease-related cognitive deterioration or normal neurocognitive slowing while aging. Materials and methods. We studied a total number of 287 cognitively normal cases, 646 of mild cognitive impairment, and 369 of Alzheimer’s disease. To work out a new marker of neurodegeneration, we created a convolutional neural network-based regression model and predicted the cognitive status of the cognitively preserved examinee from the brain MRI data. This was a model of normal aging. A big deviation from the model suggests a high risk of accelerated cognitive decline. Results. The deviation from the model of normal aging can accurately distinguish cognitively normal subjects from MCI patients (AUC = 0.9957). We also achieved creditable performance in the MCI-versus-AD classification (AUC = 0.9793). We identified a considerable difference in the MMSE test between A-positive and A-negative demented individuals according to ATN-criteria (6.27±1.82 vs 5.32±1.9;  $p< 0.05$ ). Conclusion. The deviation from the model of normal aging can be potentially used as a marker of dementia and as a tool for differentiating Alzheimer’s disease from non-Alzheimer’s dementia. To find and justify a reliable threshold levels, further research is required},

  abstract={Recent advances in deep learning have led to increased adoption of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)-based Alzheimer’s disease (AD) detection. AD results in widespread damage to neurons in different brain regions and destroys their connections. However, current CNN-based methods struggle to relate spatially distant information effectively. To solve this problem, we propose a graph reasoning module (GRM), which can be directly incorporated into CNN-based AD detection models to simulate the underlying relationship between different brain regions and boost AD diagnosis performance. Specifically, in GRM, an adaptive graph Transformer (AGT) block is designed to adaptively construct a graph representation based on the feature map given by CNN, a graph convolutional network (GCN) block is adopted to update the graph representation, and a feature map reconstruction (FMR) block is built to convert the learned graph representation to a feature map. Experimental results demonstrate that the insertion of the GRM in the existing AD classification model can increase its balanced accuracy by more than 4.3%. The GRM-embedded model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with current deep learning-based AD diagnosis methods, with a balanced accuracy of 86.2%.},

  abstract={The existing diagnostic methods for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) require considerable time and expense from patients, and approaches employing machine learning have also failed to address these issues.

We used an attention mechanism to obtain higher diagnosis performance. To improve the image quality robustness of our model, training was conducted using input image masking with the strategy of random erasing data augmentation method. We demonstrate that our proposed model performs superior to other mobile device-targeted state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.927 on the validation dataset from the UK Biobank. Finally, we also successfully emulated the proposed model and tested its operation on a smartphone application.

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) ranks as the sixth leading cause of death, emphasizing the need for early-stage prediction to prevent its progression. Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical tests, manually comparing, visualizing, and analyzing data is often difficult and time-consuming. As a result, a computational approach for accurately predicting brain changes through the classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans becomes highly valuable, though challenging. This paper introduces a novel method for diagnosing the early stages of AD by utilizing an efficient mapping technique to differentiate between affected and normal MRI scans. The approach combines a hybrid unsupervised learning framework, specifically the adaptive moving self-organizing map (AMSOM) method integrated with Fuzzy K-means. To ensure optimal feature extraction, we introduce a hybrid learning framework that embeds feature vectors in a subspace. The analysis compares various mapping approaches to identify features linked to Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 95.75% on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) MRI brain image database, outperforming existing methods.},

  abstract={Machine learning approaches for predicting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression can substantially assist researchers and clinicians in developing effective AD preventive and treatment strategies. This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm to predict the AD progression utilising a multi-task ensemble learning approach. Specifically, we present a novel tensor multi-task learning (MTL) algorithm based on similarity measurement of spatio-temporal variability of brain biomarkers to model AD progression. In this model, the prediction of each patient sample in the tensor is set as one task, where all tasks share a set of latent factors obtained through tensor decomposition. Furthermore, as subjects have continuous records of brain biomarker testing, the model is extended to ensemble the subjects’ temporally continuous prediction results utilising a gradient boosting kernel to find more accurate predictions. We have conducted extensive experiments utilising data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and model. Results demonstrate that the proposed model have superior accuracy and stability in predicting AD progression compared to benchmarks and state-of-the-art multi-task regression methods in terms of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire and The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) cognitive scores. Brain biomarker correlation information can be utilised to identify variations in individual brain structures and the model can be utilised to effectively predict the progression of AD with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores of AD patients at different stages.},

  abstract={In neuropathological diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), neuroimaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) play crucial roles in the realm of Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) by leveraging edge intelligence resources. However, accurately classifying MRI scans based on neurodegenerative diseases faces challenges due to significant variability across classes and limited intra-class differences. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach aimed at improving the early detection of AD through MRI imaging. This method integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Cascade Attention Model (CAM-CNN). The CAM-CNN model outperforms traditional CNNs in AD classification accuracy and processing complexity. In this architecture, the attention mechanism is effectively implemented by utilizing two constraint cost functions and a cross-network with diverse pre-trained parameters for a two-stream architecture. Additionally, two new cost functions, Satisfied Rank Loss (SRL) and Cross-Network Similarity Loss (CNSL), are introduced to enhance collaboration and overall network performance. Finally, a unique entropy addition method is employed in the attention module for network integration, converting intermediate outcomes into the final prediction. These components are designed to work collaboratively and can be sequentially trained for optimal performance, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of AD stage classification and robustness to interference from MR images. Validation using the Kaggle dataset demonstrates the model's accuracy of 99.07% in multiclass classification, ensuring precise classification and early detection of all AD subtypes. Further validation across three feature categories with varying numbers confirms the robustness of the proposed approach, with deviations from the standard criteria of less than 1%. Applied in Alzheimer's patient care, this capability holds promise for enhancing value-based therapy and clinical decision-making. It aids in differentiating Alzheimer's patients from healthy individuals, thereby improving patient care and enabling more targeted therapies.},

  abstract={Being the most commonly known neurodegeneration, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is annually diagnosed in millions of patients. The present medical scenario still finds the exact diagnosis and classification of AD through neuroimaging data as a challenging task. Traditional CNNs can extract a good amount of low-level information in an image while failing to extract high-level minuscule particles, which is a significant challenge in detecting AD from MRI scans. To overcome this, we propose a novel Granular Feature Integration method to combine information extraction at different scales along with an efficient information flow, enabling the model to capture both broad and fine-grained features simultaneously. We also propose a Bi-Focal Perspective mechanism to highlight the subtle neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in the MRI scans, ensuring that critical pathological markers are accurately identified. Our model achieved an F1-Score of 99.31%, precision of 99.24%, and recall of 99.51%. These scores prove that our model is significantly better than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) CNNs in existence.},

Timely identification is essential to enhance patient outcomes and inform therapy choices. This research introduces an extensive deep learning model for multiclass Alzheimer’s disease stage classification using structural MRI images from the publicly accessible OASIS dataset. The procedure begins with thorough preprocessing, including skull stripping, axial slice extraction, and intensity normalization to guarantee uniform input quality. Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is used to produce authentic synthetic MRI slices, therefore addressing data imbalance and enhancing class representation and training stability. The EffSwin-XNet model introduces a novel hybrid deep learning framework that strategically fuses EfficientNet-B0 and the Swin Transformer, enabling both local and global feature extraction from MRI brain images. This represents a significant advancement over conventional convolutional neural networks and a feature fusion attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes discriminative features. Grad-CAM is used for explainability to view the brain areas influencing each categorization judgment, hence increasing therapeutic confidence.

Hence, new solutions for preventing, detecting and supporting persons with AD are required. The aim of this paper is to develop a prototype that provides psychological support services and ensures secure sending of information that can be investigated by a family member to protect the person with AD. The designed wearable prototype is able to classify the detected images into two categories including family/non family member based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Moreover, our prototype enables tracking the location of the person with AD. Furthermore, our IoT prototype protects the images captured by the webcam through the steganography technique that allows the recipient to decode the original image using a key. Another feature of the developed prototype concerns the possibility of communication via voice messages between the person with AD and his/her member. Additionally, our prototype integrates Google assistant for supporting the persons with AD and therefore answering his/her questions, reducing social isolation and predicting his/her psychological status. So far, our prototype tracks the location of the person with AD and sends an alert if the person leaves a specified area. Our prototype is useful for persons who are affected by mild and moderate AD. It supports them for remembering their family members and recognizing other people after decrypting the extra information hidden in the images. Our results show that our prototype is effective for detecting the images of the family members of a person with AD while ensuring a high accuracy and precision compared to other benchmark techniques.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurological brain disorders, developing gradually and primarily causing the deterioration of brain function, leading to memory loss and behavioral changes. Early detection through computer-aided systems is crucial for effective intervention and treatment, providing automated and highly accurate diagnoses of Alzheimer’s by analyzing brain scans, such as MRI, to assess atrophy in key regions like the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Recently, many researchers have been developing computer-aided AD recognition systems using various technologies. However, existing approaches face challenges in achieving good performance due to difficulties in capturing complex spatial features and handling high-dimensional data. This study proposes a Gradual Variation-Based Dual-Stream Deep Learning (DL) framework for Spatial Feature Enhancement with Dimensionality Reduction to address these challenges. The method begins by converting MRI voxel data into slice images, followed by the extraction of gradual spatial variations based on the Haar Wavelet Transform (WT) to capture large-scale structural changes. These features are processed through a dual-stream DL model, where each stream captures complementary spatial features. The concatenated features are refined using a channel attention (CA) module, which selects the most discriminative features while performing dimensionality reduction to retain only the most important information, eliminating redundant or less informative features. Finally, a DL-based classification module is applied to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. We evaluated the model on two datasets, Complete 1Yr 1.5T and Complete 3Yr 3T, from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), using MRI scans from three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal). The proposed method achieved 99.05% accuracy, 99.05% precision, 99.05% recall, 99.73% ROC-AUC, and 99.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These results demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of our approach for early Alzheimer’s diagnosis, offering a valuable tool for clinical applications.},

The best SVM classification performance reached an accuracy of 0.73 by using advanced measures compared to more standard ones. Moreover, the explainability analysis suggested the results’ stability and the central role of the cingulum to show early sign of AD.By relying on SVM classification and XAI interpretation of the outcomes, AMURA indices can be considered viable markers for amyloid and tau pathology. Clinical impact: This pre-clinical research revealed AMURA indices as viable imaging markers for timely AD diagnosis by acquiring clinically feasible dMR images, with advantages compared to more invasive methods employed nowadays.},

  abstract={The key histopathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) include extensive brain shrinkage and amyloid plaques made up of amyloid beta (A $\beta $ ) deposition, as well as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) made up of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated Tau protein. The existence of AD is primarily a complicated biological and neurodegenerative illness, and various computer modeling techniques to overcome the complexity of the disease are needed. Moreover, the study of brain disorders, large-scale brain models, or connectomes, depends heavily on high-performance computing (HPC). This systematic review intends to answer five key questions about the function of the HPC in the early diagnosis of the AD, as the best contender for dealing with the high-dimensional problems. This review also intends to review the previous articles on the HPC for the early diagnosis of the AD and the computational performance solutions in the literature, which could be used for increasing the diagnostic speed and the research output. The previous articles on the topic are found using the following search codes: ALL = (“parallel processing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “high performance computing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “parallel computing” AND “Alzheimer’s disease” OR “parallel processing” AND “Alzheimer” OR “high performance computing” AND “Alzheimer” OR “parallel computing” AND “Alzheimer”) between the years 2014 and 2023. The scientific literature analysis based on the visualizations is conducted using the VOSviewer program. Using both the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 298 results, which include 196 open access papers, 71 papers with enriched cited references and 12 review articles, are analyzed. According to the findings of the classifications, AD is the most frequent cause of dementia globally, and there is currently no specific therapy that slows its course. However, the HPC could provide some rapid computations of various modeling methodologies, allowing each aspect of the brain to be seen. Some institutes are attempting to simulate prospective remedies for the disease. Various approaches are integrated to be utilized in the literature with the help of the HPC in this review, and to enlighten readers about the current status of the HPC technologies for the early detection and treatment of the AD across the world. The high-performance algorithms and approaches for the AD are major scientific challenges that may encounter several issues as well.},

  abstract={We propose a novel framework for integrating fragmented multi-modal data in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research using large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. While traditional multi-modal analysis requires matched patient IDs across datasets, our approach demonstrates population-level integration of MRI, gene expression, biomarkers, EEG, and clinical indicators from independent cohorts. Statistical analysis identified significant features in each modality, which were connected as nodes in a knowledge graph. LLMs then analyzed the graph to extract potential correlations and generate hypotheses in natural language. This approach revealed several novel relationships, including a potential pathway linking metabolic risk factors to tau protein abnormalities via neuroinflammation (r>0.6, p<0.001), and unexpected correlations between frontal EEG channels and specific gene expression profiles (r=0.42-0.58, p<0.01). Cross-validation with independent datasets confirmed the robustness of major findings, with consistent effect sizes across cohorts (variance <15%). The reproducibility of these findings was further supported by expert review (Cohen’s  $\kappa =0.82$ ) and computational validation. Our framework enables cross-modal integration at a conceptual level without requiring patient ID matching, offering new possibilities for understanding AD pathology through fragmented data reuse and generating testable hypotheses for future research.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) presents a significant global health challenge, necessitating accurate and early prediction methods for effective intervention and treatment planning. In this work, a novel approach to meta-learning for the prediction of AD is proposed, which leverages the combined power of neural processes (NPs) and transformer architectures. We introduce a framework that integrates NPs with a transformer encoder to model the complex temporal dependencies inherent in longitudinal health data, where our model learns to capture subtle patterns and variations indicative of disease progression. The novelty of our approach lies in the fusion of NPs, renowned for their ability to model stochastic processes, with transformer architectures, known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This combination enables our model to effectively adapt to individual patient trajectories and generalize across diverse populations, enhancing its predictive performance and robustness. We trained our proposed model with the Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution dataset (TADPOLE), which contains three classes: Cognitively Normal (CN), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model enhances the prediction of these models in terms of mAUC, Recall, and Precision by  $0.937\pm 0.014$ ,  $0.920\pm 0.010$ , and  $0.923\pm 0.009$ , respectively. These findings prove the efficacy of the proposed framework in accurately predicting the progression of AD, highlighting its potential for early detection and personalized treatment strategies.},

  abstract={Game theory-inspired deep learning using a generative adversarial network provides an environment to competitively interact and accomplish a goal. In the context of medical imaging, most work has focused on achieving single tasks such as improving image resolution, segmenting images, and correcting motion artifacts. We developed a dual-objective adversarial learning framework that simultaneously 1) reconstructs higher quality brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs) that 2) retain disease-specific imaging features critical for predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We obtained 3-Tesla, T1-weighted brain MRIs of participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=342) and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC, N =190) datasets. We simulated MRIs with missing data by removing 50% of sagittal slices from the original scans (i.e., diced scans). The generator was trained to reconstruct brain MRIs using the diced scans as input. We introduced a classifier into the GAN architecture to discriminate between stable (i.e., sMCI) and progressive MCI (i.e., pMCI) based on the generated images to facilitate encoding of disease-related information during reconstruction. The framework was trained using ADNI data and externally validated on NACC data. In the NACC cohort, generated images had better image quality than the diced scans (Structural similarity (SSIM) index:  $0.553 \pm 0.116$  versus  $0.348 \pm 0.108$ ). Furthermore, a classifier utilizing the generated images distinguished pMCI from sMCI more accurately than with the diced scans (F1-score:  $0.634 \pm 0.019$  versus  $0.573 \pm 0.028$ ). Competitive deep learning has potential to facilitate disease-oriented image reconstruction in those at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive neurodegenerative diseases, and the number of AD patients has increased year after year with the global aging trend. The onset of AD has a long preclinical stage. If doctors can make an initial diagnosis in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, it is possible to identify and screen those at a high-risk of developing full-blown AD, and thus the number of new AD patients can be reduced. However, there are problems with the medical datasets including AD data, such as insufficient number of samples and different data distributions. Transfer learning, which can effectively solve the problem of distribution discrepancy between training and test data and an insufficient number of target samples, has attracted increasing attention over recent years. In this paper, we propose a multi-source ensemble transfer learning (METL) approach by introducing ensemble learning and our tri-transfer model that uses Tri-Training, which ensures the transferability of source data by the tri-transfer model and high performance through ensemble learning. The experimental results on the benchmark and AD datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach has effective transferability, robustness, and feasibility, and is superior to existing algorithms. Based on METL, we propose an auxiliary diagnosis system for the initial diagnosis of AD, which helps doctors identify patients in the MCI stage as quickly as possible and with high accuracy so that measures can be taken to prevent or delay the occurrence of AD.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health priority. Hippocampus is one of the most affected areas of the brain and is easily accessible as a biomarker using MRI images in machine learning for diagnosing AD. In machine learning, using entire MRI image slices showed lower accuracy for AD classification. We present the select slices method by landmarks on the hippocampus region in MRI images. This study aims to see which views of MRI images have higher accuracy for AD classification. Then, to get the value of three views and categories, we used multiclass classification with the publicly available Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset using Resnet50 and LeNet. The models were used in a total dataset of 4,500 MRI slices in three views and categories. Our study demonstrated that the selecting slices performed better than using entire slices in MRI images for AD classification. Our method improves the accuracy of machine learning, and the coronal view showed higher accuracy. This method played a significant role in improving the accuracy of machine learning performance. The results for the coronal view were similar to the medical experts usually used to diagnose AD. We also found that LeNet models became the potential model for AD classification.},

  abstract={Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting the elderly population. The therapy of AD depends heavily on an early diagnosis. In this study, our primary objective is to evaluate the classification framework, which combines graph theory and machine learning techniques for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to distinguish AD, early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and healthy control (HC). Methods: A novel multi-feature selection method, incorporating the dual graph theoretical approach, is proposed for classification. This method utilizes three different feature selection methods after brain areas selection through graph-theory analyses in 96 subjects with brain parcellation by using the joint human connectome project multimodal parcellation (J-HCPMMP) of 180 areas per hemisphere. Results: The classification results show that the optimal features selected by the minimal redundancy maximal relevance (MRMR) based on support vector machine linear (SVM-linear) from graph measures for 36 areas of 360 areas. The classification accuracies for identifying HC vs. EMCI, HC vs. LMCI, HC vs. AD, EMCI vs. LMCI, LMCI vs. AD, and EMCI vs. AD, are 85.60%, 92.90%, 96.80%, 83.30%, 84.90% and 89.50%, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicate that the combination of graph measures and machine learning in fMRI connectivity analysis might be helpful for the diagnosis of AD, especially the use of local measures, which may better reflect functional changes in local brain regions because of cognitive impairment.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is a degenerative disease that affects the age progression and causes the brain to be unable to fulfill its expected functions. Depending on the stage, the effects of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) vary from forgetting the names of the surrounding people to not being able to continue daily life without assistance. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no generally accepted diagnostic or treatment methods. In this study, a binary version of the artificial bee colony algorithm (BABC) is proposed as a feature selector for classifying AD from volumetric and statistical data of brain magnetic resonance images (MRIs). MRIs were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Volumetric and statistical data from the collected MRIs were obtained from an online system called volBrain. Then, for comparison, binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), binary grey wolf optimization (BGWO), and binary differential evolution (BDE) were employed. For a comprehensive comparison, three algorithms, K-nearest Neighborhood (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), are used as classifiers in feature selection progress. The results of this comparison demonstrate that BGWO outperforms BABC, which is a competitive method for this purpose. The outputs of the experiments show that all methods achieve their personal best by using RF as the classifier. Additionally, traditional data mining methods such as the Info Gain (IG), Gain Ratio (GR), Chi-square (CHI), and ReliefF methods were utilized for comparison. The results also demonstrate the superiority of the BABC over traditional methods. Another research point that this study focused on was to explore which parts of the brain are more relevant for AD diagnosis. The novelty of this study lies in the output of this point. Alongside the hippocampus and amygdala, the globus pallidus can also help in AD diagnosis.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the progressive accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles in the brain. Due to the lack of a cure for Alzheimer’s disease, early and accurate diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective early interventions to slow disease progression. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has emerged as a promising modality for early diagnosis, providing detailed insights into brain structure alterations associated with AD. However, domain shift due to variations in imaging protocols and data distribution among national cohorts remains a challenge for the application of MRI in clinical diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose AttCORAL, a novel Domain-Adaptive Attention Network for Early Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis, integrating attention mechanisms with Correlation Alignment (CORAL) loss to effectively mitigate domain discrepancy, enhancing the model’s robustness and generalization. We evaluate AttCORAL on two large-scale MRI datasets—Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers, and Lifestyle Study (AIBL)—which differ in acquisition protocols and demographics. While these datasets provide a valuable basis for cross-cohort validation, we acknowledge that further multi-cohort studies are necessary to fully assess global generalizability. To ensure the reliability of our approach, we apply Grad-CAM to visualize the pathological brain regions most informative for our model’s predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that AttCORAL significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art studies, highlighting its effectiveness in early diagnosis of AD across diverse imaging domains.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is largely the underlying cause of dementia due to its progressive neurodegenerative nature among the elderly. The disease can be divided into five stages: Subjective Memory Concern (SMC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Early MCI (EMCI), Late MCI (LMCI), and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Alzheimer’s disease is conventionally diagnosed using an MRI scan of the brain. In this research, we propose a fine-tuned convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier called AlzheimerNet, which can identify all five stages of Alzheimer’s disease and the Normal Control (NC) class. The ADNI database’s MRI scan dataset is obtained for use in training and testing the proposed model. To prepare the raw data for analysis, we applied the CLAHE image enhancement method. Data augmentation was used to remedy the unbalanced nature of the dataset and the resultant dataset consisted of 60000 image data on the 6 classes. Initially, five existing models including VGG16, MobileNetV2, AlexNet, ResNet50 and InceptionV3 were trained and tested to achieve test accuracies of 78.84%, 86.85%, 78.87%, 80.98% and 96.31% respectively. Since InceptionV3 provides the highest accuracy, this model is later modified to design the AlzheimerNet using RMSprop optimizer and learning rate 0.00001 to achieve the highest test accuracy of 98.67%. The five pre-trained models and the proposed fine-tuned model were compared in terms of various performance matrices to demonstrate whether the AlzheimerNet model is in fact performing better in classifying and detecting the six classes. An ablation study shows the hyperparameters used in the experiment. The suggested model outperforms the traditional methods for classifying Alzheimer’s disease stages from brain MRI, as measured by a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with a significance of <0.05.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a serious chronic health problem that causes great pain and loss to patients and their families. Its early and accurate diagnosis would achieve significant progress on the prevention and treatment of the disease. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a commonly used technique in nuclear medical diagnostics. However, it is still a challenging problem to diagnose AD, Control Normal (CN), and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) because of the complex structures of MRI. In this paper, diagnosing models for MRI images are proposed to identify the various stages of AD based on the Broad Learning Systems (BLS), as well as its convolutional variants. To verify the validity of the proposed models, experiments on MRI images collected from the ADNI website are tested and evaluated. The results show that our algorithms outperform the other state-of-the-art algorithms for various tasks with better accuracy and less training times. Finally, the cross-domain learning ability of the proposed algorithms is verified on an independent AD dataset.},

  pages={108603-108616},
  abstract={Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) can identify subtle brain changes due to its high contrast for soft tissues and high spatial resolution. It has been widely used in diagnosing neurological brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the size of 3D high-resolution data poses a significant challenge for data analysis and processing. Since only a few areas of the brain show structural changes highly associated with AD, the patch-based methods dividing the whole data into several regular patches have shown promising for more efficient image analysis. The major challenges of the patch-based methods include identifying the discriminative patches, combining features from the discrete discriminative patches, and designing appropriate classifiers. This work proposes a novel efficient patch-based deep learning network (sMRI-PatchNet) with explainable patch localisation and selection for AD diagnosis. Specifically, it consists of two primary components: 1) A fast and efficient explainable patch selection method for determining the most discriminative patches; and 2) A novel patch-based network for extracting deep features and AD classification with position embeddings to retain position information, capable of capturing the global and local information of inter- and intra-patches. This method has been applied for the AD classification and the prediction of the transitional state moderate cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion with real datasets. The experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method can identify discriminative pathological locations effectively with a significant reduction on patch numbers used, providing better performance in terms of accuracy, computing performance, and generalizability, in contrast to the state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the elderly and leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Treatments for stopping or slowing the progression of AD have not been discovered yet; therefore, delaying the progression of AD is the only option, which makes early diagnosis of AD crucial. Additionally, although  $\text{A}\beta $  plaques and tau proteins are considered the causes of early AD, few studies have used this information to diagnose early AD. In this study, a middle-fusion multimodal model is proposed for the diagnosis of early AD. The proposed multimodal model extracts features without loss using a depthwise separable convolution block without an activation function. Subsequently, middle fusion is applied using mix skip connection and sharing weight convolution blocks, both designed to learn the complex relationships between modalities. In contrast to other studies, the proposed approach has three main novelties. 1) A middle-fusion multimodal model is proposed for the early diagnosis of AD. 2) The proposed model is evaluated using the entire ADNI series, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (T1w MRI) and 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) from the ADNI1 dataset, as well as  $\text{A}\beta $  PET and tau protein PET from ADNI2 and ADNI3 datasets. 3) A novel region-of-interest (ROI) extraction method is proposed for the hippocampus, middle temporal, and inferior temporal regions, which are known to be affected in the early stages of AD. In the experimental results, the proposed multimodal model achieved a balanced accuracy of 1.00, for the task of Alzheimer’s disease vs cognitive normal (CN) and 0.76 for the task of mild cognitive impairment vs cognitive normal.},

In order to make full use of rs-fMRI data, this study constructed a dynamic spatiotemporal graph neural network model, which mainly includes three modules: temporal block, spatial block, and graph pooling block. Our proposed model can extract the BOLD signal of the subject’s fMRI data and the spatial structure of functional connections between different brain regions, and improve the decision-making results of the model. In the study of AD, MCI and NC, the classification accuracy reached 83.78% outperforming previously reported, which manifested that our model could effectively learn spatiotemporal, and dynamic spatio-temporal method plays an important role in identifying different groups of subjects. In summary, this paper proposed an end-to-end dynamic spatio-temporal graph neural network model, which uses the information of the temporal dimension and spatial structure in rs-fMRI data, and achieves the improvement of the three classification performance among AD, MCI and NC.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a neurological brain disorder marked by dementia and neurological dysfunction that affects memory, behavioral patterns, and reasoning. Alzheimer’s disease is an incurable disease that primarily affects people over 40. Alzheimer’s disease is diagnosed through a manual evaluation of a patient’s MRI scan and neuro-psychological examinations. Deep Learning (DL), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has pioneered new approaches to automate medical image diagnosis. This study aims to create a reliable and efficient system for classifying AD using MRI by applying the deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture for detecting AD with relatively few parameters, and the proposed solution is ideal for training a smaller dataset. This proposed model successfully distinguishes the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and shows class activation maps as a heat map on the brain. The proposed Alzheimer’s Disease Detection Network (ADD-Net) is built from scratch to precisely classify the stages of AD by decreasing parameters and calculation costs. The Kaggle MRI image dataset has a significant class imbalance problem, and we exploited a synthetic oversampling technique to evenly distribute the image among the classes to prevent the problem of class imbalance. The proposed ADD-Net is extensively evaluated against DenseNet169, VGG19, and InceptionResNet V2 using precision, recall, F1-score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and loss. The ADD-Net achieved the following values for evaluation metrics: 98.63%, 99.76%, 98.61%, 98.63%, 98.58%, and 0.0549% accuracy, AUC, F1-score, precision, recall, and loss, respectively. The simulation results show that the proposed ADD-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art models in all the evaluation metrics.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It usually manifests through progressive loss of cognitive function and memory, subsequently impairing the person’s ability to live without assistance and causing a tremendous impact on the affected individuals and society. Currently, AD diagnosis relies on cognitive tests, blood tests, behavior assessments, brain imaging, and medical history analysis. However, these procedures are subjective and inconsistent, making an accurate prediction for the early stages of AD difficult. This paper introduces a curvelet transform (CT) based-convolutional neural network (CNN) (DeepCurvMRI) model for improving the accuracy of early-stage AD disease detection using from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. The MRI images were first pre-processed using CT, and then a CNN model was trained using the new image representation. In this study, we used Alzheimer’s MRI images dataset hosted on the Kaggle platform to train DeepCurvMRI for multi and binary classification tasks. DeepCurvMRI achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of  $98.62\% \pm 0.10\%$ ,  $99.05\% \pm 0.10\%$ ,  $98.50\% \pm 0.03\%$ , and 99.21± 0.08, respectively, using the leave-one-group-out (LOGO) cross-validation approach in multi-classification task. The highest accuracy obtained in binary classification is  $98.71\% \pm 0.05\%$ . In addition to LOGO, DeepCurvMRI was tested using randomly stratified 10-fold and 5-fold cross validation. These encouraging results are superior to the ones reported in related methods, showcasing the potentiality of DeepCurvMRI in capturing the key anatomical changes in MRI images that can be differentiated between various staged of Alzheimer’s disease classes.},

  abstract={Objective: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects a significant percentage of the elderly. EEG has emerged as a promising tool for the timely diagnosis and classification of AD or other dementia types. This paper proposes a novel approach to AD EEG classification using a Dual-Input Convolution Encoder Network (DICE-net). Approach: Recordings of 36 AD, 23 Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 29 age-matched healthy individuals (CN) were used. After denoising, Band power and Coherence features were extracted and fed to DICE-net, which consists of Convolution, Transformer Encoder, and Feed-Forward layers. Main results: Our results show that DICE-net achieved an accuracy of 83.28% in the AD-CN problem using Leave-One-Subject-Out validation, outperforming several baseline models, and achieving good generalization performance. Significance: Our findings suggest that a convolution transformer network can effectively capture the complex features of EEG signals for the classification of AD patients versus control subjects and may be expanded to other types of dementia, such as FTD. This approach could improve the accuracy of early diagnosis and lead to the development of more effective interventions for AD.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a significant cause of dementia worldwide, and its progression from mild to severe affects an individual’s ability to perform daily activities independently. The accurate and early diagnosis of AD is crucial for effective clinical intervention. However, interpreting AD from medical images can be challenging, even for experienced radiologists. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic diagnosis of AD, and researchers have investigated the potential of utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly deep learning models, to address this challenge. This study proposes a framework that combines a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to detect AD characteristics from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images accurately and reliably. The ViT identifies crucial features from the input image, and the GRU establishes clear correlations between these features. The proposed model overcomes the class imbalance issue in the MRI image dataset and achieves superior accuracy and performance compared to existing methods. The model was trained on the Alzheimer’s MRI Preprocessed Dataset obtained from Kaggle, achieving notable accuracies of 99.53% for 4-class and 99.69% for binary classification. It also demonstrated a high accuracy of 99.26% for 3-class on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Baseline Database. These results were validated through a thorough 10-fold cross-validation process. Furthermore, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques were incorporated to make the model interpretable and explainable. This allows clinicians to understand the model’s decision-making process and gain insights into the underlying factors driving the AD diagnosis.},

  abstract={Machine learning algorithms have been used for detection (and possibly) prediction of Alzheimer’s disease using genotype information, with the potential to enhance the outcome prediction. However, detailed research about the analysis and the detection of Alzheimer’s disease using genetic data is still in its primitive stage. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the scientific literature on the use of various machine learning approaches for the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease based solely on genetic data. To identify gaps in the literature, critically appraise the reporting and methods of the algorithms, and provide the foundation for a wider research programme focused on developing novel machine learning based predictive algorithms in Alzheimer’s disease. A systematic review of quantitative studies was conducted using three search engines (PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus), and included studies between  $1^{\mathrm {st}}$  of January 2010 and  $31^{\mathrm {st}}$  December 2021. Keywords used were ‘Alzheimer’s disease(s)’, ‘GWAS, ‘Artificial intelligence’ and their synonyms. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 24 studies were included. Machine learning methods in the reviewed papers performed in a wide range of ways (0.59 to 0.98 AUC). The main findings showed that high risk of bias in the analysis can be linked to feature selection, hyperparameter search and validation methods.},

  abstract={The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the proportion of the elderly will soon include nearly a quarter of the world population. Ensuring that health systems are prepared to deal with this phenomenal rate of aging and associated diseases generates many challenges. Among these challenges is facing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that may occur at some point in the elderly life and may harm societies. AD is considered a neurological, psychological, mental, and health setback. The Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) can improve patient care and support many medical functions, such as diagnosing diseases that can reduce preventable harm. This research's main objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Ontology (ADDO). It is a comprehensive semantic knowledge base toward the development of fuzzy ontology-based CDSS for AD diagnosis. ADDO can serve as a core component of CDSS, which provides representation, annotation, and access to aspects related to AD's study and diagnosis. Toward the management of this objective, ADDO is based on the essentials of the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) and follows the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and the Ontology for General Medical Sciences (OGMS) principles. ADDO focuses on representing the patient characteristics, complications, drugs, diagnosis examination tests, and key aspects of their periodic visits in a standard way. The possibility of semantic interoperability is taken into account by integrating ADDO and a heterogeneous AD dataset. We used ADNI as a case study to mapping a set of real instances. To manage the medical domain's uncertainty, ADDO is extended to fuzzy ontology to accommodate the medical linguistic variables and enhance diagnosis results' efficiency. ADDO is constructed using Protégé 5.5.0 software and evaluated using the HermiT reasoner and SPARQL semantic queries. ADDO currently includes 7060 concepts, 99 properties, 46274 axioms, and 30708 annotations. As a result, ADDO is consistent and more reliable in managing most AD aspects than other existing AD ontologies.},

  abstract={Detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in its earliest stages, particularly during an onset of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), remains challenging due to the overlap of initial symptoms with normal aging processes. Given that no cure exists and current medications only slow the disease’s progression, early identification of at-risk individuals is crucial. The combination of eye-tracking and speech analysis offers a promising diagnostic solution by providing a non-invasive method to examine differences between healthy controls and individuals with MCI, who may progress to develop AD. In this study, we analyzed a multimodal clinical eye-tracking and speech dataset collected from 78 participants (37 controls, 20 MCI, and 21 AD) during the King-Devick test and a reading task to classify and diagnose MCI/AD versus healthy controls. To that end, we developed a Fusion Neural Network, a deep learning-based classification model that integrates gaze and speech-derived features, including pupil size variations, fixation duration, saccadic movements, and speech delay, to improve MCI diagnosis performance. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 79.2% for MCI diagnosis and 82% for AD. Our findings indicate that features related to pupil size and eye-speech temporal dynamics are strong indicators for detection tasks. Moreover, the results indicate that using multimodal data (gaze + speech) significantly improves classification accuracy compared to unimodal data from speech or gaze alone.},

  abstract={Multiple imaging modalities and specific proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, providing a comprehensive understanding of neurodegenerative disorders, have been widely used for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Given the proven effectiveness of contrastive learning in aligning multi-modal representation, in this paper, we investigate effective contrastive learning strategies to learn better cross-modal representations for the integration of multi-modal complementary information. To enhance the overall performance in AD diagnosis, we construct a unified hybrid network that integrates feature learning and classifier learning into an end-to-end framework. Specifically, we propose a weighted multi-modal contrastive learning based on hybrid network (WMCL-HN) method. Firstly, an adaptive weighted strategy is implemented on the multi-modal contrastive learning to dynamically regulate the degree of information exchange across modalities. It assigns higher weights to more important modality pair, thus the most important underlying relationships across modalities can be captured. Secondly, we construct a hybrid network, which employs a curriculum learning strategy that gradually transitions the training from feature learning to classifier learning, ensuring that the learned features are tailored to the diagnostic task. Experimental results on ADNI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed WMCL-HN in AD-related diagnosis tasks. The source code is available at https://github.com/pcehnago/WMCL-HN.},

  abstract={Clinical methods for dementia detection are expensive and prone to human errors. Despite various computer-aided methods using electroencephalography (EEG) signals and artificial intelligence, a reliable detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a challenge. The existing EEG-based machine learning models have limited performance or high computation complexity. Hence, there is a need for an optimal deep learning model for the detection of AD. This paper proposes a low-complexity EEG-based AD detection CNN called LEADNet to generate disease-specific features. LEADNet employs spatiotemporal EEG signals as input, two convolution layers for feature generation, a max-pooling layer for asymmetric spatiotemporal redundancy reduction, two fully-connected layers for nonlinear feature transformation and selection, and a softmax layer for disease probability prediction. Different quantitative measures are calculated using an open-source AD dataset to compare LEADNet and four pre-trained CNN models. The results show that the lightweight architecture of LEADNet has at least a 150-fold reduction in network parameters and the highest testing accuracy of 99.24% compared to pre-trained models. The investigation of individual layers of LEADNet showed successive improvements in feature transformation and selection for detecting AD subjects. A comparison with the state-of-the-art AD detection models showed that the highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were achieved by the LEADNet model.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia globally. It steadily worsens from mild to severe, impairing one’s ability to complete any work without assistance. It begins to outstrip due to the population ages and diagnosis timeline. For classifying cases, existing approaches incorporate medical history, neuropsychological testing, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), but efficient procedures remain inconsistent due to lack of sensitivity and precision. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to create a framework that can be used to detect specific Alzheimer’s disease characteristics from MRI images. By considering four stages of dementia and conducting a particular diagnosis, the proposed model generates high-resolution disease probability maps from the local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and provides accurate, intuitive visualizations of individual Alzheimer’s disease risk. To avoid the problem of class imbalance, the samples should be evenly distributed among the classes. The obtained MRI image dataset from Kaggle has a major class imbalance problem. A DEMentia NETwork (DEMNET) is proposed to detect the dementia stages from MRI. The DEMNET achieves an accuracy of 95.23%, Area Under Curve (AUC) of 97% and Cohen’s Kappa value of 0.93 from the Kaggle dataset, which is superior to existing methods. We also used the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to predict AD classes in order to assess the efficacy of the proposed model.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease in older adults. With increasing life expectancy, the incidence of this disease is expected to increase over time. Individuals who are carriers of the  $\varepsilon 4$  allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE  $\varepsilon 4$ ) have a greater chance of developing AD. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a relatively inexpensive and non-invasive method that can help diagnose neurodegenerative diseases. Event-Related Potentials (ERP) analysis is an EEG tool widely used in the literature to help identify AD. In this study, the Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) tool was added, a novel application for identifying carriers of the APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  allele. We subdivided the individuals into four groups: control group of APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  carriers (CT-C), control group of non-APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  carriers (CT-N), AD carrying APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  (AD-C), and AD without APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  (AD-N). The extraction of ERP and ERSP features from EEG can be used as classifier features using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The EEGLAB tool was used for the data preparation and feature extraction pipeline to search for statistically significant differences between the groups. Python programming language was also used with the aid of the scikit-learn library to perform feature selection and classification. Among the classifiers we used, we identified greater accuracy and technical advantage in the use of Support Vector Machine (SVM). We also found that ERSP was more effective than ERP in terms of the ML accuracy. Interestingly, this study also observed statistically significant differences in the pre-stimulus interval (−500 to 0 ms) for ERSP, and not only in the post-stimulus interval that is generally used for cognitive studies. This study proposed a machine learning classification method to identify APOE  $\varepsilon 4$  allele carriers in older adults with AD and cognitively healthy older adults. Using ERP alone, the performance was poor, but with the use of ERSP, the performance was much better, and with the fusion of ERP and ERSP, the accuracy values were even higher. Besides the classification accuracy, we added the F1 score as a performance metric.INDEX TERMS Alzheimer’s disease, Apolipoprotein E, event-related potentials, event-related spectral perturbation, machine learning, feature selection.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most frequent method of dementia and ranks the fifth-leading disease. Brain imaging or neuroimaging like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilized in the medicinal analysis of brain condition to allow visualization of infrastructure and brain functionality. Machine learning (ML) approaches on MRI are utilized in the analysis of AD to accelerate the analysis procedure and assist doctors. But, in typical ML approaches utilizing handcrafted extracting feature systems on MRI are difficult, and requires the contribution of expert users. So, executing deep learning (DL) as an automatic extracting feature system is minimizing require for extracting features and automate the procedure. This article introduces a novel Biomedical Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis using Enhanced Manta ray Foraging Optimization based Deep Learning (ADD-EMRFODL) technique on brain MRI. The presented ADD-EMRFODL technique exploits Gabor filtering (GF) technique as a pre-processing step. Also, the presented ADD-EMRFODL technique utilizes densely connected network (DenseNet-121) model to derive feature vectors. Finally, the ADD process is performed via EMRFO with back propagation neural network (BPNN) classifier. The parameter tuning of the BPNN occurs utilizing the EMRFO algorithm with the intention of enhanced classification accuracy. To depict the improvised ADD performance of the ADD-EMRFODL methodology, a comprehensive set of simulations was effectuated. The results stated the improved outcomes of the ADD-EMRFODL algorithm over other current methodologies.},

  abstract={The most common neurological brain issue is Alzheimer’s disease, which can be diagnosed using a variety of clinical methods. However, the electroencephalogram (EEG) is shown to be effective in detecting Alzheimer’s disease. The purpose of this research is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system that can diagnose Alzheimer’s disease using EEG data. In the present study, a band-pass elliptic digital filter was used to eliminate interference and disturbances from the EEG dataset. Next, the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique has been employed to decompose the filtered signal into its frequency bands in order to extract the features of EEG signals. Then, different signal features such as logarithmic band power, standard deviation, variance, kurtosis, average energy, root mean square, and Norm have been integrated into the DWT technique to generate the feature vectors and improve the diagnosis performance. After that, nine machine learning approaches have been investigated to classify EEG features into their corresponding classes: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), support vector machine (SVM), Naïve bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), decision tree (DT), extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural network (ANN), and random forests (RF). Finally, the performance of the different proposed machine learning approaches have been compared and evaluated by computing the sensitivity, specificity, overall diagnosis accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and plotting the ROC curves and confusion matrices for five classification problems. These investigations aim to compare the proposed approaches and recommend the best combination method for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disorders. According to the results, the KNN classifier achieved an average classification accuracy of 99.98% with an area under the ROC curve of 100%. Our findings show that the suggested methodologies are an appealing supplementary tool for identifying possible biomarkers to help in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract={Deep neural networks have shown promising results in the analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data for the diagnosis of dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Different regions of the brain have diverse structures that are linked to specific functions, which could account for the variability in disease-related changes observed in sMRI scans of these areas. Understanding the overall characteristics of sMRI data is important since current popular convolutional neural networks (CNN) for deep learning do not consider the interconnection of voxels. Vision transformers have shown effectiveness in identifying long-distance connections in the brain, which has led to their success in applications such as disease detection. However, the image noise and limited scalability of self-attention mechanisms in relation to image size has hindered their widespread use in advanced Alzheimer’s analysis. To enhance information retention and reduce network complexity, this study presents a novel adaptable efficient receptive field feature extraction network. Moreover, an advanced attention mechanism with both local grid attention block and dilated global attention module has been incorporated to highlight the characteristics of AD. Next, a more improved hierarchical inverted residual feed forward network in place of multi-layer perceptron is suggested to enhance the characterization of features through the integration of information from both lower and higher layers. Finally, the global average pooling and  $1\times 1$  convolution are used to reduce dimensionality, enhance non-linearity, and allow channel interactions in feature maps before being input into the classification head. The network achieved high performance in various scenarios, with average accuracies of 97.29% for AD vs. HC and 94.79% for MCI vs. HC classification using ADNI as experimental datasets.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is considered the 6 $^{\text {th}}$  leading cause of death worldwide. Early diagnosis of AD is not an easy task, and no preventive cures have been discovered yet. Having an accurate computer-aided system for the early detection of AD is important to help patients with AD. This study proposes a new approach for classifying disease stages. First, we worked on the MRI images and split them into an appropriate format to avoid data leakage. Subsequently, a simple and fast registration-free preprocessing pipeline was applied to the dataset. Numerous experiments were conducted to analyze the performances of different 3D classification architectures. Finally, an ensemble learning approach is applied to the top-performing models. The outstanding performance of the proposed method was demonstrated using augmentation of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our proposed ensemble approach outperforms studies in literature for distinguishing between people with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and MCI and cognitive normal (CN) with an AUC score of 91.28% and 88.42%, respectively. We also targeted the multiclass task, which was marginalized in previous work, by differentiating between the three stages of the disease.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition characterised by permanent cognitive decline. The financial burden associated with providing care for those affected by this ailment has escalated to a significant magnitude, amounting to billions of dollars. Moreover, projections indicate that the prevalence of this sickness is anticipated to surge by more than 200% throughout the next 15-year period. Numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts to the field of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), whereby computational methods are used to discern and diagnose various medical conditions. Nevertheless, the identification of persons afflicted with the condition does not mitigate the adverse consequences. It would be advantageous to identify individuals who may be susceptible to the onset of AD at an early stage. This might enhance the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions and the implementation of preventive measures for AD. The challenge is to determine the best method for predicting the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD while accounting for two factors: (a) how to represent the three-dimensional (3D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, since processing these images takes a long time, a lot of computational power, and the accuracy may not be very good; and (b) how best to combine the images while maintaining their individual image information. To solve the problem, this research examined two imaging modalities, namely MRI and PET, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The modalities were used to investigate the creation of a method for selecting slices from 3D scans for eventual conversion into 2D images and to combine the imagery obtained from the slice selection of the modalities into one used in the CNNs. The purpose of developing the integration was to tackle the issue of insufficient data and retain the information from the two modalities while improving the accuracy in performance simultaneously. The image classification process demonstrated a much quicker performance, completing the test in just 0.285% of the time needed by a 3D-CNN for the identical task and achieving an accuracy of 94.0%.},

  abstract={A progressive neurological disorder, Alzheimer’s disease has a significant social and economic impact and has become more problematic for world health. Early and precise diagnosis is critical to enable timely intervention to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a new multimodal AI framework integrating advanced MRI preprocessing techniques and speech analysis for the enhancement of the detection of AD. A strong preprocessing pipeline, including noise reduction, normalization, skull stripping, and segmentation, is utilized to prepare the MRI data. Cognitive and acoustic biomarkers are extracted through spectrograms and pre-trained linguistic models to create speech features. The architecture involves the application of Vision Transformers for spatial analysis and a hybrid CNN- RNN architecture to derive contextual insights, making the framework applicable to multimodal fusion for holistic diagnosis. The framework achieved an accuracy of 94.2% with precision, recall, and F1-scores higher than 92% in the experimental evaluation on a diverse dataset. Comparative analysis with several recent studies further emphasizes that the framework provides better diagnostic performance on key metrics. This work advances early AD detection by incorporating complementary data modalities, addressing existing gaps in unimodal approaches, and providing a scalable, interpretable solution for clinical application.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disease that severely impairs cognitive function. Early detection is critical for effective treatment and management. Machine Learning (ML) methods are often used to ensure early detection and prediction. However, ML has various issues, including the data island problem. The fragmentation that results from the data island problem makes building reliable, effective ML models more complex, and it is particularly problematic in industries where privacy is a concern, like healthcare. Federated Learning (FL) can help tackle the data island problem by keeping sensitive patient data decentralized and enabling many institutions to work together on model training without exchanging raw data, all while maintaining privacy compliance. As Random Forest (RF) is proven to be the best-performing classifier in this research, an RF classifier is used to create FL. The model incorporates multiple data modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) segmentation and clinical and psychological data, to capture the variety of characteristics influencing the progress of AD. Another concerning issue with ML is its uninterpretable character. We use SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques that emphasize important factors impacting model decisions in order to improve predictability and transparency. This explainability promotes confidence in AI-based diagnoses by enabling researchers and physicians to comprehend the underlying mechanisms guiding the predictions. The combination of XAI, FL, and Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-3) Multimodal data offers an interpretable, scalable, reliable, and privacy-centered solution for multiple complex issues, such as predicting AD. This approach results in better diagnosis precision, greater security, and increased confidence in AI technologies, making it a novel methodology in medical sciences. With data privacy maintained, our method produces 98.93% accurate predictions, providing a solid detection strategy for AD. The suggested approach’s F1-score, Precision, Recall, and AUC are 98.93%, 98.94%, 98.93%, and 99.97%, respectively. This work also shows that a multimodal dataset performs better than a single modal dataset.},

  abstract={Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) plays a crucial role in the clinical application of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are highly sensitive to subtle changes caused by brain atrophy in medical images (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, MRI). Due to computational resource constraints, most CAD methods focus on quantitative features in specific regions, neglecting the holistic nature of the images, which poses a challenge for a comprehensive understanding of pathological changes in AD. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight dual multi-level hybrid pyramid convolutional neural network (DMA-HPCNet) to aid clinical diagnosis of AD. Specifically, we introduced ResNet as the backbone network and modularly extended the hybrid pyramid convolution (HPC) block and the dual multi-level attention (DMA) module. Among them, the HPC block is designed to enhance the acquisition of information at different scales, and the DMA module is proposed to sequentially extract different local and global representations from the channel and spatial domains. Our proposed DMA-HPCNet method was evaluated on baseline MRI slices of 443 subjects from the ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed DMA-HPCNet model performs efficiently in AD-related classification tasks with low computational cost.},

  abstract={Objective: Despite the potential of machine learning techniques to improve dementia diagnostic processes, research outcomes are often not readily translated to or adopted in clinical practice. Importantly, the time taken to administer diagnostic assessment has yet to be taken into account in feature-selection based optimisation for dementia diagnosis. We address these issues by considering the impact of assessment time as a practical constraint for feature selection of cognitive and functional assessments in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. Methods: We use three different feature selection algorithms to select informative subsets of dementia assessment items from a large open-source dementia dataset. We use cost-sensitive feature selection to optimise our feature selection results for assessment time as well as diagnostic accuracy. To encourage clinical adoption and further evaluation of our proposed accuracy-vs-cost optimisation algorithms, we also implement a sandbox-like toolbox with graphical user interface to evaluate user-chosen subsets of assessment items. Results: We find that there are subsets of accuracy-cost optimised assessment items that can perform better in terms of diagnostic accuracy and/or total assessment time than most other standard assessments. Discussion: Overall, our analysis and accompanying sandbox tool can facilitate clinical users and other stakeholders to apply their own domain knowledge to analyse and decide which dementia diagnostic assessment items are useful, and aid the redesigning of dementia diagnostic assessments. Clinical Impact (Clinical Research): By optimising diagnostic accuracy and assessment time, we redesign predictive and efficient dementia diagnostic assessments and develop a sandbox interface to facilitate evaluation and testing by clinicians and non-specialists.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is a hereditary neuro-degenerative disorder whose typical form causes amnestic cognitive impairment and less common variants cause non-amnestic cognitive impairment. The aim of the paper is to classify and localize magnetic resonance images of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Cognitively Normal. We propose a method for the automatic detection and localization of Alzheimer’s disease, by proposing a neural network designed by authors i.e., TriAD. One of the distinctive features of the proposed network is its ability to process three simultaneous input MRI images of the brain corresponding to the three reference planes (axial, coronal, and sagittal). The assembly of these three classifications has led to excellent quantitative results (95% in accuracy, precision, and recall) and punctual heatmaps for the localization of the region of interest in the images. Moreover, we show how visual explainability can increase the trustworthiness and reliability in the adoption of deep learning by the medical staff. The main novelty, the TriaAD network, guarantees good performances from a quantitative and qualitative point of view, providing a very precise classification and localization of Alzheimer’s disease images.},

Effective early diagnosis and treatment of AD is of fundamental importance as it can reduce disease progression, allow more effective management of symptoms, facilitate timely patient access to advice and support, and lower associated costs of health care. Given that Alzheimer's typically progresses in stages over an extended period of time, we propose that automated analysis of time sequential data may enhance disease prediction. We present a novel time-series Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Model (ADPM) comprising Random Forest (RF) region of interest (ROI) selection and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) prediction. Experiments show that our methodology achieves higher classification accuracy in comparison to existing algorithms, and can facilitate prediction of early onset AD. Furthermore, testing demonstrates that random forest ROI selection can identify disease-relative brain regions across different image modalities (MRI, PET, DTI).},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a disease that develops gradually, ultimately causing deterioration of brain functions. Thus, early diagnosis is essential for treating and managing AD. Magnetic-resonance-imaging (MRI)-based AD diagnosis classifies the stage of AD according to the extent of atrophy caused to a patient’s hippocampal and entorhinal cortex. In this case, the shape of the patient’s brain serves as a crucial feature. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify the AD stage according to the shape of a patient’s brain. The proposed model is structured by combining a convolutional layer part of the visual geometry group network (VGGNet) model, with proven performance in image classification, and a 1D CNN model into a pipeline. Here, the 1D CNN applies the line segment feature analysis (LFA) algorithm to MRI images to transform the visual line segment information of the images into vectors and record strong features indicating the shape of the brain. This is followed by 1D CNN model training. Notably, the 1D CNN model can carefully observe the brain shape owing to the parallel connection of ten 1D convolutional layers with LFA features. Subsequently, the brain shape information is combined with features obtained from the original image through the VGGNet to improve the model performance compared to that of existing methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ensemble CNN model, MRI datasets collected from Kaggle are used to evaluate and compare the proposed model with existing image classification methods and methods proposed in related studies. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model demonstrates superior performance with an accuracy of 0.986 and a loss of 0.0385.},

  abstract={Brain state classification by applying deep learning techniques on neuroimaging data has become a recent topic of research. However, unlike domains where the data is low dimensional or there are large number of available training samples, neuroimaging data is high dimensional and has few training samples. To tackle these issues, we present a sparse feedforward deep neural architecture for encoding and decoding the structural connectome of the human brain. We use a sparsely connected element-wise multiplication as the first hidden layer and a fixed transform layer as the output layer. The number of trainable parameters and the training time is significantly reduced compared to feedforward networks. We demonstrate superior performance of this architecture in encoding the structural connectome implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) from DTI brain scans. For decoding, we propose recursive feature elimination (RFE) algorithm based on DeepLIFT, layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP), and Integrated Gradients (IG) algorithms to remove irrelevant features and thereby identify key biomarkers associated with AD and PD. We show that the proposed architecture reduces 45.1% and 47.1% of the trainable parameters compared to a feedforward DNN with an increase in accuracy by 2.6 % and 3.1% for cognitively normal (CN) vs AD and CN vs PD classification, respectively. We also show that the proposed RFE method leads to a further increase in accuracy by 2.1% and 4% for CN vs AD and CN vs PD classification, while removing approximately 90% to 95% irrelevant features. Furthermore, we argue that the biomarkers (i.e., key brain regions and connections) identified are consistent with previous literature. We show that relevancy score-based methods can yield high discriminative power and are suitable for brain decoding. We also show that the proposed approach led to a reduction in the number of trainable network parameters, an increase in classification accuracy, and a detection of brain connections and regions that were consistent with earlier studies.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the leading form of dementia worldwide. AD disrupts neuronal pathways and thus is commonly viewed as a network disorder. Many studies demonstrate the power of functional connectivity (FC) graph-based biomarkers for automated diagnosis of AD using electroencephalography (EEG). However, various FC measures are commonly utilised, as each aims to quantify a unique aspect of brain coupling. Graph neural networks (GNN) provide a powerful framework for learning on graphs. While a growing number of studies use GNN to classify EEG brain graphs, it is unclear which method should be utilised to estimate the brain graph. We use eight FC measures to estimate FC brain graphs from sensor-level EEG signals. GNN models are trained in order to compare the performance of the selected FC measures. Additionally, three baseline models based on literature are trained for comparison. We show that GNN models perform significantly better than the other baseline models. Moreover, using FC measures to estimate brain graphs improves the performance of GNN compared to models trained using a fixed graph based on the spatial distance between the EEG sensors. However, no FC measure performs consistently better than the other measures. The best GNN reaches 0.984 area under sensitivity-specificity curve (AUC) and 92% accuracy, whereas the best baseline model, a convolutional neural network, has 0.924 AUC and 84.7% accuracy.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Though it is not yet curable or reversible, research has shown that clinical intervention or intensive cognitive training at an early stage may effectively delay the progress of the disease. As a result, screening populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or early AD via efficient, effective and low-cost cognitive assessments is important. Currently, a cognitive assessment relies mostly on cognitive tests, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which must be performed by therapists. Also, cognitive functions can be divided into a variety of dimensions, such as memory, attention, executive function, visual spatial and so on. Executive functions (EF), also known as executive control or cognitive control, refer to a set of skills necessary to perform higher-order cognitive processes, including working memory, planning, attention, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control. Along with the fast progress of virtual reality (VR) and artificial intelligence (AI), this study proposes an intelligent assessment method aimed at assessing executive functions. Utilizing machine learning to develop an automatic evidence-based assessment model, behavioral information is acquired through performing executive-function tasks in a VR supermarket. Clinical trials were performed individuals with MCI or early AD and six healthy participants. Statistical analysis showed that 45 out of 46 indices derived from behavioral information were found to differ significantly between individuals with neurocognitive disorder and healthy participants. This analysis indicates these indices may be potential bio-markers. Further, machine-learning methods were applied to build classifiers that differentiate between individuals with MCI or early AD and healthy participants. The accuracy of the classifier is up to 100%, demonstrating the derived features from the VR system were highly related to diagnosis of individuals with MCI or early AD.},

  abstract={Dementia is a leading cause of global mortality, with limited treatment options available. Patients progress through three stages: cognitive normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Accurate prediction of these stages can significantly slow deterioration. Recent research suggests analyzing MRI images, focusing on markers like whole brain, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex atrophy, is diagnostically valuable. However, most methods analyze 2D MRI images, losing anatomical context. Our study processes 3D MRI data with AC-PC alignment correction and extracts radiomic features from the segmented hippocampus, followed by discretization and principal component analysis for optimization. Machine learning and deep learning methods are then used for classification with cross-validation, achieving the highest accuracy with support vector machine (SVM). Compared with other studies, our results show the highest accuracy among the three dementia severity classifications. Combining the radiomic features from segmented hippocampus in MRI with machine learning promises unprecedented accuracy in predicting dementia severity, potentially slowing progression and enhancing patients’ quality of life.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder prevalent in older adults, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. A deep learning model can automatically classify Alzheimer’s disease from magnetic resonance imaging to aid clinicians in diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for disease detection in medical images, but their performance is limited due to inadequate labeled data, high inter-class similarity, and overfitting problems. Key hyperparameters influencing CNN performance include the number of convolution layers and filters assigned to each convolution layer. About other hyperparameters, numerous combinations exist. Since CNN models take a long time to train, it is quite costly to try all combinations to find the optimal model. Existing studies have optimized only a few hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer in custom and transfer learning models. In this study, we propose an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization to fine-tune the hyperparameters, including the number of convolution layers, filters, and other hyperparameters, in CNN architectures designed to classify Alzheimer’s disease severity. Using the proposed lightweight model, Alzheimer’s disease was accurately classified with an accuracy of 99.53% and an F1-score of 99.63% on a public dataset. Our model surpasses the performance of previous studies, offering the potential to alleviate the burden on doctors and expedite their decision-making processes.

The HCP brain atlas provides a more detailed cortical parcellation of the brain, allowing for more precise localization of brain regions related to MCI and AD. Finally, the framework archive 88% accuracy in the task of identifying MCI-C. 46 brain regions are suggested as potential MCI-to-AD biomarkers.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a psychological disorder in elderly people which causes severe intellectual disabilities. Proper processing of neuro-images can provide differences in brain tissues which may help in diagnosing the disease more effectively. But, due to the complex structures, this is a challenge in differentiating the brain tissues and classifying AD using traditional classification mechanisms. Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a machine learning technique that has the ability to absorb the most important information for classifying an object accurately. LeNet is a popular DNN based model with a simple and effective architecture that also consumes very less implementation time. As like most of the DNN models, LeNet also uses MaxPooling layer for dimensionality reduction by eliminating the information of minimum valued elements. In brain images low intensity valued pixels also may contain very important features. To keep the minimum valued elements too in the network, we have created a separate layer that performs Min-Pooling operation. MinPooling and MaxPooling layers are then concatenated together. Finally, we have replaced all MaxPooling Layers in LeNet by the concatenated layers. We have analysed and compared the performances of modified LeNet model with 20 other most commonly used DNN models, and some of the related works. It is observed that, the modified LeNet model achieved the highest performances. It is also observed that, original LeNet model can classify AD with a performance rate of 80%, whereas, the proposed modified LeNet model achieved an average performance rate of 96.64%.},

  abstract={The development of computerized healthcare has been powered by diagnostic imaging and machine learning techniques. In particular, recent advances in deep learning have opened a new era in support of multimedia healthcare distribution. For earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease, the study suggested the Improved Deep Learning Algorithm (IDLA) and statistically significant text information. The specific information in clinical text includes the age, sex and genes of the person and apolipoprotein E; the brain function is established using resting-state functional data (MRI) for the measurement of connectivity in the brain regions. A specialized network of autoencoders is used in earlier diagnosis to distinguish between natural aging and disorder progression. The suggested approach incorporates effectively biased neural network functionality and allows a reliable Alzheimer's disease recognition. In comparison with conventional classifiers depends on time series R-fMRI results, the proposed deep learning algorithm has improved significantly and, in the best cases, the standard deviation reduced by 45%, indicating the forecast model is more reliable and efficient in relation to conventional methodologies. The work examines the benefits of improved deep learning algorithms from recognizing high-dimensional information in healthcare and can lead to the early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract={Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a very challenging problem and has been attempted through data-driven methods in recent years. However, considering the inherent complexity in decoding higher cognitive functions from spontaneous neuronal signals, these data-driven methods benefit from the incorporation of multimodal data. This work proposes an ensembled machine learning model with explainability (EXML) to detect subtle patterns in cortical and hippocampal local field potential signals (LFPs) that can be considered as a potential marker for AD in the early stage of the disease. The LFPs acquired from healthy and two types of AD animal models (n = 10 each) using linear multielectrode probes were endorsed by electrocardiogram and respiration signals for their veracity. Feature sets were generated from LFPs in temporal, spatial and spectral domains and were fed into selected machine-learning models for each domain. Using late fusion, the EXML model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.4%. This provided insights into the amyloid plaque deposition process as early as 3 months of the disease onset by identifying the subtle patterns in the network activities. Lastly, the individual and ensemble models were found to be robust when evaluated by randomly masking channels to mimic the presence of artefacts.},

Although many recent studies have used computers to diagnose AD, most machine detection methods are limited by congenital observations. AD can be diagnosed-but not predicted-at its early stages, as prediction is only applicable before the disease manifests itself. Deep Learning (DL) has become a common technique for the early diagnosis of AD. Here, we briefly review some of the important literature on AD and explore how DL can help researchers diagnose the disease at its early stages.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a hazardous neurological disorder of people aged in the early 60s. The main symptoms of AD is significant memory loss. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a state of dementia in which a patient exhibits the early symptoms of AD. Since brain is the most impacted region, the disorders can be classified by analyzing factors from brain tissues in different subjects. Machine Learning (ML) is a widely utilised concept that aids in the decision-making process. Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DNN) is a type of ML techniques that uses artificially connected neurons to mimic the human brain. In this work, we have proposed a novel DNN-based model for distinguishing AD and MCI patients from Cognitively Normal individuals. Inspired by the original VGG-19, we have created 19 deep layers in the network. In Back Propagation, deeper models suffer from the problem of vanishing gradient and information loss. As a solution, we borrowed the Dense-Block notion from the original DenseNet architecture, which provides a path of information exchange amongst all the layers. Furthermore, we have implemented depth-wise convolutional procedures to make the model computationally faster. Outcome of the proposed model is compared with some prominent DNN models and observed that, the proposed approach performs most convincingly with an average performance rate of 95.39%.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is caused by cortical degeneration leading to memory loss and dementia. A possible criterion for the early identification of Alzheimer’s dementia is to identify the difference between positive and negative linguistic and cognitive abilities of the patients. This study involves the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), designed a hybrid model with CNN & Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bidirectional LSTM), and proposed a Stacked Deep Dense Neural Network (SDDNN) model for text classification and prediction of Alzheimer’s dementia. These models were trained end-to-end using DementiaBank clinical transcript dataset. The transcripts consisted of recorded interviews of Alzheimer’s patients with clinical experts. The models were investigated under two settings: Randomly initialized and Glove embedding. Further, hyperparameter optimization was accomplished using GridSearch, which yielded optimal parameters for the design of suitable learning models for most accurate predictions. Other parameters were computed and compared based on AUC, accuracy, specificity, precision, F1 score, and recall. To ensure performance generalization, the classification accuracy was tested using 10-fold cross-validation approach. The performance and classification accuracy of the proposed model was significantly improved to 93.31% when applied with Glove embedding and hyperparameter tuning. This research work will considerably help the clinical experts in early detection and diagnosis of AD.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s dementia (AD) affects memory, language, and cognition and worsens over time. Therefore, it is critical to develop a reliable method for early detection of permanent brain atrophy and cognitive impairment. This study used clinical transcripts, a text-based adaptation of the original audio recordings of Alzheimer’s patients. This audio transcript data were taken from DementiaBank, which is the largest public dataset of AD transcripts. This study aims to show how Transfer Learning-based models and swarm intelligence optimization techniques can be used to predict Alzheimer’s disease. To enhance the prediction performance for Alzheimer’s disease, a hybrid swarm intelligence linguistic feature selection (HSI-LFS) approach is proposed that extracts a combined feature set using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Dragonfly Optimization (DO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithms. In addition, a transfer learning-based model called HSI-LFS-BERT, a combination of the HSI-LFS feature selection method and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT) algorithm, is proposed. The proposed model was compared using two feature sets: the first set consisted of the initial feature set and the second set contained a hybrid feature set that was extracted using the suggested HSI-LFS method. BERT embedding with HSI-LFS outperformed the conventional feature set, providing the most accurate modeling parameters while reducing the computations by 27.19%. The proposed HSI-LFS-BERT model outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving 98.24% accuracy, 91.56% precision, and 98.78% recall.},

  abstract={Cognitive deficits in each brain are likely to be associated with alterations in brain connectivity. Given the vast number of connections, studying and identifying these changes is neither practical nor efficient. Therefore, we use a minimum spanning tree (MST) to address these challenges. We hypothesize that there is a global subgraph for each cognitive disease that consists of the most repeated connections for each group and because of the slow changes of the disease, we call this “disease-specific subgraph”. To validate this model, two datasets are used, a MEG dataset with 80 subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy control (HC), and an EEG dataset recorded from 88 subjects: 36 AD, 23 frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and 29 HC. The weighted phase lag index (wPLI), phase lag index (PLI), and phase locking value (PLV) were employed to assess the functional connectivity and brain graph construction. However, due to less sensitivity to volume conduction and noise, wPLI was utilized to construct the graph and MST matrices. The results and the location of hub nodes showed higher integrated graphs of AD, MCI and FTD which is related to poorer cognitive performance and compatible with physiological observations. Moreover, the characteristics of MST matrices of subjects were used as cognition features and showed high classification rates in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract={Identification of amyloid beta ( $\text{A}\beta$ ) plaques in the cerebral cortex in models of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is of critical importance for research into therapeutics. Here we propose an innovative framework which automatically measures  $\text{A}\beta $  plaques in the cortex of a rodent model, based on anatomical segmentation using a deep learning approach. The framework has three phases: data acquisition to enhance image quality using preprocessing techniques and image normalization with a novel plaque removal algorithm, then an anatomical segmentation phase using the trained model, and finally an analysis phase to quantitate  $\text{A}\beta $  plaques. Supervised training with 946 sets of mouse brain section annotations exhibiting  $\text{A}\beta $  protein-labeled plaques ( $\text{A}\beta $  plaques) were trained with deep neural networks (DNNs). Five DNN architectures: FCN32, FCN16, FCN8, SegNet, and U-Net, were tested. Of these, U-Net was selected as it showed the most reliable segmentation performance. The framework demonstrated an accuracy of 83.98% and 91.21% of the Dice coefficient score for atlas segmentation with the test dataset. The proposed framework automatically segmented the somatosensory cortex and calculated the intensity and extent of  $\text{A}\beta $  plaques. This study contributes to image analysis in the field of neuroscience, allowing region-specific quantitation of image features using a deep learning approach.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease causing memory loss and brain protein accumulation. Early diagnosis is crucial for clinical trials and patient care. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have improved diagnosis and prognosis, but doctors need to interpret images proficiently. Deep learning technology has shown potential in detecting Alzheimer’s disease, but the disease progresses slower in early phases. A new dual-attention convolutional autoencoder model is presented, offering improved detection abilities and potential for real-time use in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis. The study utilized two datasets: the first ADNI dataset, which includes three classes (MCI, CN, and AD), and the second Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Dataset, which includes two distinct classes (AD and MCI). We analyze the effectiveness of our proposed model by evaluating key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC score. In addition, we utilize cross-validation and mean absolute error to validate our model while also fine-tuning the parameters. Based on experimental data, the proposed model accurately detected Alzheimer’s disease with an accuracy of 0.9902 ± 0.0139. Based on the results, the proposed model demonstrates excellent performance compared to the existing methods described in the literature. The proposed mode achieves precision, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.9882 ± 0.0587, 0.9898 ± 0.0865, 0.9912 ± 0.0872 respectively. The model achieved an AUC score of 0.9992 for MCI and 0.9919 for AD class. Furthermore, the proposed method can enhance the affordability of Alzheimer’s disease diagnostics and increase the rate of early AD detection by facilitating remote healthcare.},

However, GNN-based diagnosis of neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), remains a relatively unexplored area of research. Previous studies have relied on functional connectivity methods to infer brain graph structures and used simple GNN architectures for the diagnosis of AD. In this work, we propose a novel adaptive gated graph convolutional network (AGGCN) that can provide explainable predictions. AGGCN adaptively learns graph structures by combining convolution-based node feature enhancement with a correlation-based measure of power spectral density similarity. Furthermore, the gated graph convolution can dynamically weigh the contribution of various spatial scales. The proposed model achieves high accuracy in both eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions, indicating the stability of learned representations. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed AGGCN model generates consistent explanations of its predictions that might be relevant for further study of AD-related alterations of brain networks.},

Explainable machine learning has been presented as a solution to this problem since it enables the identification of significant attributes and gives a clearer method of making predictions. In this study, Genome-Wide Association Studies were used to recognize genetic variants associated with Alzheimer’s disease, utilizing the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and quality control methods to ensure the validity and reliability of the findings. The results indicate strong connections between certain genetic variations and Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting the potential of Genome-Wide Association Studies as a valuable tool for identifying and predicting this disease. After studying and analyzing the genetic data, machine learning algorithms are utilized to train a model to detect Alzheimer. The Support Vector Machine achieved 89% accuracy as the best-performing model. Explainable machine learning has the potential to increase the accuracy and interpretability of Alzheimer’s disease detection models, giving significant insights for both academics and physicians. The explanation of the support vector machine model reveals that rs4821510 is the most important SNP in detecting AD. On top of that, the SHAP method shows that rs429358 is an indication for Alzheimer’s disease and rs4821510 presents in the healthy ones. These findings suggest that explainable machine learning can play an important role in accurately detecting Alzheimer’s disease and identifying critical genetic markers associated with the disease.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about the integrity of white matter fiber bundles that are related to the neuropathological mechanisms, and it is one of the commonly used techniques in AD research. In this study, we first divided each subject’s brain into 90 regions based on the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) brain atlas. The average fractional anisotropy (FA) values between each pair of regions were applied to construct a brain network. We utilized the number of voxels with fibers passing through each brain region as the node features. The brain networks and node features were input into a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCN) structure involving the self-attention pooling mechanism proposed in this study to classify AD and normal controls (NC). The classification performance was compared among different preprocessed brain networks and node features. The final classification result achieved an accuracy of 87.5%.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a widespread, chronic, irreversible, and degenerative condition, and its early detection during the prodromal stage is of utmost importance. Typically, AD studies rely on single data modalities, such as MRI or PET, for making predictions. Nevertheless, combining metabolic and structural data can offer a comprehensive perspective on AD staging analysis. To address this goal, this paper introduces an innovative multi-modal fusion-based approach named as Dual-3DM3-AD. This model is proposed for an accurate and early Alzheimer’s diagnosis by considering both MRI and PET image scans. Initially, we pre-process both images in terms of noise reduction, skull stripping and 3D image conversion using Quaternion Non-local Means Denoising Algorithm (QNLM), Morphology function and Block Divider Model (BDM), respectively, which enhances the image quality. Furthermore, we have adapted Mixed-transformer with Furthered U-Net for performing semantic segmentation and minimizing complexity. Dual-3DM3-AD model is consisted of multi-scale feature extraction module for extracting appropriate features from both segmented images. The extracted features are then aggregated using Densely Connected Feature Aggregator Module (DCFAM) to utilize both features. Finally, a multi-head attention mechanism is adapted for feature dimensionality reduction, and then the softmax layer is applied for multi-class Alzheimer’s diagnosis. The proposed Dual-3DM3-AD model is compared with several baseline approaches with the help of several performance metrics. The final results unveil that the proposed work achieves 98% of accuracy, 97.8% of sensitivity, 97.5% of specificity, 98.2% of f-measure, and better ROC curves, which outperforms other existing models in multi-class Alzheimer’s diagnosis.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss, behavioral changes, and impaired self-care, often preceded by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Not all MCI cases progress to AD, creating a diagnostic challenge. This study proposes a novel framework for early AD diagnosis using T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The approach integrates the Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map (AMSOM), a neural network technique for unsupervised training and tissue segmentation, with K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature selection. AMSOM dynamically updates neuron weights to improve segmentation accuracy. Classification is performed using various algorithms, evaluated on sensitivity, accuracy, precision, and similarity metrics. Compared to existing techniques such as Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and hybrid Self-Organizing Mapping-K-means (SOM-FKM), the proposed method demonstrates statistically significant improvements in tissue segmentation and classification. It achieved a mean accuracy of 99.8%, reducing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) from 2.3 to 0.44 and improving the Discriminative Overlap Index (DOI) and Tissue Clarity (TC) values to 0.435105 and 0.282381, respectively. Implemented in MATLAB, this method provides a robust, efficient framework for early AD detection, surpassing existing approaches in precision and reliability.},

  abstract={Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is frequently misdiagnosed as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to similar clinical symptoms. In this study, we constructed frequency-based multilayer resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) networks and extracted representative network features to improve the differentiation between AD and FTD. When compared with healthy controls (HC), AD showed primarily stronger delta-alpha cross-couplings and weaker theta-sigma cross-couplings. Notably, when comparing the AD and FTD groups, we found that the AD exhibited stronger delta-alpha and delta-beta connectivity than the FTD. Thereafter, by extracting the representative network features and then applying these features in the classification between AD and FTD, an accuracy of 81.1% was achieved. Finally, a multivariable linear regressive model was built, based on the differential topologies, and then adopted to predict the scores of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Accordingly, the predicted and actual measured scores were indeed significantly correlated with each other ( ${r}$  = 0.274,  ${p}$  = 0.036). These findings consistently suggest that frequency-based multilayer resting-state networks can be utilized for classifying AD and FTD and have potential applications for clinical diagnosis.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are the most burdensome neurodegenerative disorders in older populations as they pose significant challenges because of subtle cognitive decline in the initial stages. This study proposes a novel approach to distinguishing AD, FTD, and cognitively normal (CN) subjects using electroencephalography (EEG) time-domain analysis through Hjorth parameters (Activity, Mobility, and Complexity). By exploring various window lengths and moving lengths to determine the optimal segment where dementia features are most pronounced, the proposed method achieved high classification accuracy across multiple diagnostic categories. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), the approach attained 92.5% accuracy for AD&FTD/CN classification. In individual group classifications, the method attained 88.6% accuracy for AD/CN using LDA and 96.0% accuracy for FTD/CN using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). AD classification demonstrated 92.6% sensitivity and 83.5% specificity, while FTD classification achieved 85.9% sensitivity and 95.5% specificity. Furthermore, a significant correlation (r =0.70,  ${p} =0.01$ ) was found between Hjorth parameters and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, validating the method’s potential for cognitive decline assessment. The optimal time segmentation approach and high classification accuracy represent substantial improvements over existing methods, offering a reliable and interpretable tool for clinical dementia diagnosis. These findings suggest that time-domain analysis using Hjorth parameters could be an effective biomarker for early dementia detection, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings.},

  abstract={Building upon the recent advances and successes in the application of deep learning to the medical field, we propose in this work a new approach to detect and classify early-stage Alzheimer patients using online handwriting (HW) loop patterns. To cope with the lack of training data prevalent in the tasks of classification of neuro-degenerative diseases from behavioral data, we investigate several data augmentation techniques. In this respect, compared to the traditional data augmentation techniques proposed for HW-based Parkinson detection, we investigate a variant of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), DoppelGANger, especially tailored for times series and hence suitable for synthesizing realistic online handwriting sequences. Based on a 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) to perform Alzheimer classification, we show, on a real dataset related to HW and Alzheimer, that our DoppelGANger-based augmentation model allow the CNN to significantly outperform both the current state of the art and the other data augmentation techniques.},

  abstract={Convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers, which perform feature extraction from brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and classify them as healthy or diseased, are very promising in aiding the diagnosis of neurological disorders. CNN models are usually optimized with first-order algorithms, e.g. stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and adaptive momentum (Adam), which are susceptible to pathological curvature of the objective function. Hessian-free optimization (HFO), a second-order algorithm, overcomes this problem and thus is expected to converge faster. Here, we investigated whether HFO can increase the training speed of CNN models for brain MRI classification into cognitively normal or Alzheimer’s disease using data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We trained two naive CNN classifiers with either HFO, SGD or Adam and compared their performance. Our results show that HFO converged at least two to four times faster than Adam and SGD. The cross-validation accuracy of the models optimized with HFO was comparable or better than those optimized with SGD or Adam. In addition, HFO was more robust to hyperparameter changes. These results comply with theory and act as a proof of concept that second-order algorithms have an advantage over first-order methods in training CNN models for MRI classification.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) accounts for the majority of dementia, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the early stage of AD. Early and accurate diagnosis of dementia plays a vital role in more targeted treatments and effectively halting disease progression. However, the clinical diagnosis of dementia requires various examinations, which are expensive and require a high level of expertise from the doctor. In this paper, we proposed a classification method based on multi-modal data including Electroencephalogram (EEG), eye tracking and behavioral data for early diagnosis of AD and MCI. Paradigms with various task difficulties were used to identify different severity of dementia: eye movement task and resting-state EEG tasks were used to detect AD, while eye movement task and delayed match-to-sample task were used to detect MCI. Besides, the effects of different features were compared and suitable EEG channels were selected for the detection. Furthermore, we proposed a data augmentation method to enlarge the dataset, designed an extra ERPNet feature extract layer to extract multi-modal features and used domain-adversarial neural network to improve the performance of MCI diagnosis. We achieved an average accuracy of 88.81% for MCI diagnosis and 100% for AD diagnosis. The results of this paper suggest that our classification method can provide a feasible and affordable way to diagnose dementia.},

  abstract={One of the most challenging tasks for neurologists is the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Early and accurate diagnosis of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage can enhance efforts to slow down the major consequences linked to this condition. Deep learning systems provide a promising performance in diagnosing the disease through neuroimaging analysis. This research aims to develop a deep learning-based system that efficiently identifies and analyzes the progression from Cognitively Normal (CN) to MCI, addressing the growing need for more accessible, accurate diagnostic tools. The proposed model comprises two distinct feature extraction paths to capture local and global image features. Each path includes advanced modules for feature refinement associated with the channel attention mechanism. The resultant output features are produced using a learned fusion technique from the two paths’ features and applied to the CN vs. MCI binary classifier. Furthermore, the proposed Suspected Subject Classifier (SSC) system applies various machine-learning methods to identify the suspected MCI subjects. The results showed a comparative performance for the binary diagnosis of CN individuals and those with MCI, achieving an accuracy of 91.6% and 88.4% for multi-class diagnoses, including the prediction of progression from normal to confirmed MCI. This study represents an exceptional stride toward predicting early MCI in normal individuals. By enhancing prediction efficiency for early disease progression in normal individuals, our method can potentially advance intervention strategies and improve patient care outcomes.},

  abstract={This review paper explores recent advances in machine learning approaches with emphasis on deep learning techniques for non-invasive cognitive impairment detection. We examine various non-invasive indicators of cognitive decline, including speech and language, facial, and motoric mobility. The paper provides an overview of relevant datasets, feature-extracting techniques, and deep-learning architectures applied to this domain. The paper comprises 60 peer-reviewed papers that mainly utilize deep learning models to detect cognitive impairment conditions. We have analyzed the performance of different methods across modalities and observed that speech and language-based methods generally achieved the highest detection performance. Studies combining acoustic and linguistic features tended to outperform those using a single modality. Facial analysis methods showed promise for visual modalities but were less extensively studied. Most papers focused on binary classification (impaired vs. non-impaired), with fewer addressing multi-class or regression tasks. Transfer learning and pre-trained language models emerged as popular and effective techniques, especially for linguistic analysis. Despite significant progress, several challenges remain, including data standardization and accessibility, model explainability, longitudinal analysis limitations, and clinical adaptation. Lastly, we propose future research directions, such as investigating language-agnostic speech analysis methods, developing multi-modal diagnostic systems, and addressing ethical considerations in AI-assisted healthcare. By synthesizing current trends and identifying key obstacles, this review aims to guide further development of deep learning-based cognitive impairment detection systems to improve early diagnosis and ultimately patient outcomes.},

  abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, and early diagnosis is critical for timely intervention and slowing down the course of the disease. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a non-invasive neuroimaging technique, can be used to detect functional brain activity. However, most of the existing graph neural network methods based on static adjacency matrices are difficult to capture individual differences and remote brain region interactions, thus limiting their classification performance and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Multi-Scale Brain Network (DMSBN) model based on resting-state fMRI, which improves the discriminative ability and biological interpretability of the model through dynamic adjacency matrix learning and multistage stochastic wandering aggregation mechanism. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy of DMSBN on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database reaches 96.57%, which is significantly better than the existing baseline methods. In addition, the brain region analysis module identified high contributing brain regions associated with Alzheimer’s disease pathology, providing new insights for early intervention. This study validates the effectiveness of dynamic neighborhood learning and multi-scale feature fusion in brain network analysis, providing a powerful aid for early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

  abstract={The early identification and treatment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) play a crucial role in managing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, current methods for categorizing progressive MCI and stable MCI based on brain MRI scans have proven insufficient due to the subtle nature of the features involved.

The primary objective of this work is to improve the feature representation of brain MRI scans for more accurate classification. The proposed model is a hybrid MCI classification system that integrates three components: the Swin Transformer, the Dimension Centric Proximity Aware Attention Network (DCPAN), and the Age Deviation Factor (ADF). The proposed network achieves better classification results through a unique feature fusion approach that combines global, local, proximal features, and dimensional dependencies. It effectively combines fine-grained details with broader contextual information to extract discriminative features. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed network, achieving an accuracy of 79.8%, precision of 76.6%, recall of 80.2%, and an F1-score of 78.4% when evaluated on the ADNI dataset.},
